<REVIEW>
We purchased two droids with high hopes. My husband loves his. I do not. After going back everyday for a week to Verizon they are telling me that my finger tempature is to high and doesn't work well with the touchscreen pad. Funny I'm typing this on my new IPad.  I'm taking back my droid and I've already gone back to my Blackberry.  Bummer. Very disappointed
