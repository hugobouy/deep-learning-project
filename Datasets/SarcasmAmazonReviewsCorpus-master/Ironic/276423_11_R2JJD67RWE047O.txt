<REVIEW>
Woe, thine gift of fire-less light! I am not one to fear the elements, but this "bi cycle light" has affected my spirit. How it works, I do not know. But it must be through mysticism and not fire, for it is not hot and nor does it flicker. Either it was formed through enchamberment of bright holy faeries or through sheer magics alone.
 
 It came to me through Amazonia, and I expect that such people of the dark jungles would find strange new manners to produce light. I have seen flash powders for making instant fires, and glass crystals that can change the color of fire and sunlight. But never have I seen light from nothingness. Amazonia must have powerful enchanters indeed.
 
 Moreso, this includes an enchanted reflector. It appears to be meant to be secured to some sort of pole, like a staff. I have secured it to my walking staff under the assumption that it protects me from evil lights, and reflects them as a harmless red glow. It's a fine idea to package both a light producer and a light consumer (shield), but nowhere is it written the form of light produced. I do hope that the enchantment is not soul-sucking and am currently testing it on a virgin's skin.
