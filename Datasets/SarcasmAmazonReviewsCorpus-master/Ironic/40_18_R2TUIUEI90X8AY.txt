<REVIEW>
I have been fasting, on water alone, for 17 days now, and I plan to withdraw to consumption again when my body tells me I should.  On every page, the wealth of Colbert's ignorance astounded me.  What he has written is secondhand drivel from health books popular in the 80s, which advised readers not to drink water during a meal, because it would "dilute the digestive enzymes and interfere with digestion."  Anyone who has opened a middle school level Biology book knows otherwise.  How is this guy a doctor?  
 
 
 He is FUNNY, however.  I often found myself laughing out loud reading this.  He appealed to the Bible and yet obviously prefers juice fasting in almost all cases, and even prohibits absolute fasts (which I've done dozens of times).  
 
 None of the fasters in the Bible "juice fasted."  Many of the spiritual leaders in the Bible did "absolute fasts," which Colbert expressly prohibits, even if God calls you to it.  So I wish Colbert would make up his mind.  Why does he advocate fasting?  Because of science, or religion?  He seems to fill the book with both (watered-down forms of each), but NEITHER support his juice-fasting dogma, as far as I can tell.  
 
 Three times he wrote, "Supergreens is equal to 6 servings of vegetables."  Huh?  Equal how?  In calories?  In antioxidants?  In fiber?  In phytonutrients?  In KILOBYTES?  In toxins?  
 
 He leaves it to the reader to make of it what the reader likes.  
 
 
 If you want a summary of what science has to say about fasting, better look elsewhere.  If you want anything concerning religion, better fast and pray before reading this quack.  He's just telling us what his grandma told him what Benny Hinn told her what Jesus told him what the Father told Him.
