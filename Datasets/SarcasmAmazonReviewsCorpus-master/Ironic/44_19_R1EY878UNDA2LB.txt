<REVIEW>
I hate this book beyond belief. The book lacks a little thing called substance. I wanted to just strangle the main character Mac. She was a little defenseless Barbie stereotype, whose delicate southern female sensibilities were hurt when somebody so much as cursed! She cant lift a finger to defend herself, and would rather slouch off her parents with a part time job, work on her tan, then do ANYTHING. It had immense potential when it came to plot but the characters made it unenjoyable. Jericho was a horrible character who did nothing but yell, bruise, and order Mac around. None of the characters are well written and have as much substance as a toilet brush, not to mention that Mac is the most worthless excuse for a heroin in any book I have read so far. Don't wast your money on this book.
