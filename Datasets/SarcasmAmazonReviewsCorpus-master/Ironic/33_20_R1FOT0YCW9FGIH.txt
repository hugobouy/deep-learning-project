So, you think you're reppin' 2 the maxx'? Yeah, right, poser. You can't hang with us. Not until you get your domepiece some TURBO FUEL MAXIMUM ENERGY SODA!!!! and take it to the next level. TURBO FUEL MAXIMUM ENERGY SODA!!!! gives you that extra edge to fully get in the man's face and totally gnar out. S-boarding up at Mt. Hood? Trippin' on a Whipple Dip? Touring world-class bong shops? Not without my TURBO FUEL MAXIMUM ENERGY SODA!!!!, bro. If you're not pounding massive TURBO FUEL MAXIMUM ENERGY SODA!!!!, get from out my face, yo.
