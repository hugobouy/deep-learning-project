<REVIEW>
Don't get me wrong.  I have to give Al credit for selling a book just by a clever title.  His book on Rush Limbaugh, though now inaccurate due to Limbaugh's weight loss, grabbed attention just by its sheer rudeness.     Now he takes on the entire right wing with his new book.  I mean, really, is it any big secret that politicians are lying to us?  Franken's real problem is that he paints just as broadly as those he attempts to indict.  The mark of a great political satirist (and there aren't many) is to point out the folly of our leaders/public figures without making us hate you while you do it.  Here Franken utterly fails.     It's a real shame, however, because he's a bright guy.  He has, unfortunately, been brainwashed by his long relationship with academia and the entertainment business.  His prose, while sometimes attempting humor, always contains that sharp edge of liberal elitism that seems to imply that you are stupid if you don't agree with his opinion.  Save your money, and invest in a library card to check-up on our leaders yourself, instead of depending on a partisan who may need checking-up on himself.
