<REVIEW>
Sex For Dummies: I saw this book while perusing Amazon, and could not believe it. Not only is this company marketing their products to mentally-challenged people, but they are doing it right out in the open! Surely the mentally-handicapped, who oftentimes work menial jobs for little or no pay, need their money more than any other group? But no, this soulless corporation keeps churning out their books designed to take our slower brothers' and sisters' last dime. How exactly are the books "For Dummies?" I'm not sure; perhaps they have large, colorful pictures or have scratch-and-sniff components. No matter, the point still stands that this company is trying to take advantage of the mentally-impared and must be stopped. 
 And furthermore, "Sex for Dummies?" Really? I'm as liberal as the next guy, but are the mentally-challenged really the kind of people we want reproducing? I'm not saying we round them up into camps or anything, but if you can figure out a way to keep `em childless, so much so the better. 
 To conclude: Not only does this book take advantage of the less-fortunate, but it strives to create a world in which there are even more of said less-fortunate. Two stars.
