<REVIEW>
this product only got one star because "no stars" wasn't an option.  it didn't remove my wart at all, in fact all it did was make my thumb look ugly for a few weeks and it helped me develop another wart right next to it...it did the opposite of takin away my wart it help me get another one! i do not recommend at all, i did everything the instructions instructed word for word, and when it didnt work the first and second time i tried it for the third time...after the first time i had developed a second wart right next to the first one and the second and third treatments didnt do anything at all.
