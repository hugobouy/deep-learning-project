<REVIEW>
So is this the best selling movie of all time?  Well it is certainly the most over hyped and overrated movie of all time.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy good science fiction movies, but this is nothing more than typical Hollywood social commentary wrapped up in a long and boring melodrama with unrealistic and drawn out action scenes.  
 
 The social commentary becomes paramount to the movie and prevents this from being any more than a simplistic storyline with stereotypical characters who have unimaginative roles.  There are no suprises here.  No unexpected turns or twists.  It almost verges on satire.  The movie is supposed to be futuristic, with complex technology, and sophisticated technological operations on planet Pandora.  You would think it would require humans with specialized training sophistication as well; yet the guy running the robotic bulldozer is portrayed as some redneck in in his flannel shirt and baseball cap.  The evil money grubbing corporate guy is dressed in a present day shirt and tie, practicing his golf skills in the middle of the operations room.  T-shirts, present day military outfits, bows and arrows?  Futuristic?  Give us a break.
