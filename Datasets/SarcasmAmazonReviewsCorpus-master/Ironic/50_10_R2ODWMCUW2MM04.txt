<REVIEW>
I bought this helmet to use for a second rider on my motorcycle. It's only good for that if you don't like your rider. It is not very well made, it runs small and the shell feels like it would crack if you dropped it. Didn't give me a whole lot of confidence that it would protect someones head in an accident. But considering the price, I guess you really can't expect to much. 
 I would only recommend you use this helmet if you are riding a scooter or moped that doesn't get up to highway speeds.
