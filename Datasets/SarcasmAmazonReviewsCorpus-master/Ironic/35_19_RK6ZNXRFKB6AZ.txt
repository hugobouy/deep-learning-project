<REVIEW>
Notice description shows 3.5 pounds... It weighs 2.5 pounds... Submitted to Amazon, see if they will correct the AD ... It's not weighty enough to "burn" my muscles... My old hand weights are 4 pounds already, so probably why.... Be great weights for a beginner child, like age 12, when first learniing to correctly use to avoid injury
