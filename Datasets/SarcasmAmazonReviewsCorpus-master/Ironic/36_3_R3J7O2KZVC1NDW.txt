<REVIEW>
Its funny to look back on the cartoons you loved as a kid and wonder why they captivated you so much. Watching it now, I'm really not sure why. Now its just hilarious. The dialogue is terrible and the amount of overtly homoeroticsm in these cartoons boils way over the top. There's one part where robotic villian, Lockjaw, struggles to find a suitable weapon for his detachable arm, and in doing so makes grunting noises and rapidly moves his arm up and down, which looks alot like a struggle of a much different kind. Just one example. I mean, c'mon! Look at Prince Adam's or He-Man's attire! Pink shirt and Purple leotards! Furry short shorts with boots! Shoulder length blond hair! Then you go through the special features and hear the creator talk, you can definitely see that the guy is gay. I mean, no problem with that, it just adds to the comedy of it all. If you have a sense of humor about these kind of things, than this cartoon is for you.
