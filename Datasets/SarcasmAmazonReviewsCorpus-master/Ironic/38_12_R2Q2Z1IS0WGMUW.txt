<REVIEW>
Silly story of uninhibited coitus between two strangers.
  Melodramatic, common erotica about amazingly endowed lovers. They overcome all odds in their quest for great physical/emotional love.
   Oh, least I forget, the usual sad, abused pasts for both of our versatile protagonists. Fortunately, the contrived angst didn't overwhelm the salacious narrative.
  The real story is the sensual appetite of these two lovers. They achieve physical satisfaction in the vertical, horizontal, dorsal and ventral positions, whether clothed or unclothed, in private or in public.
  Hooray for Passion! What stamina!
 I can not say that this was well written. No.  Nor was there any remarkable literary form or style - excepting the overuse of the common street terms for male and female reproductive organs. 
  The author has used her abilities and energies to create a slight erotic fantasy. The Novel was acceptable. It was not-very-Victorian, not-very-historical, not-very-exciting erotica. 
  Not recommended.
