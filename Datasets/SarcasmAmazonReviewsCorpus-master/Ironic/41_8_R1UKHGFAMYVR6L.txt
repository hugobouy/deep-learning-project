<REVIEW>
Wow... the first one was at least good to read the first time, but this just sucked. 
 
 I'm the kind of girl who hated Romeo and Juliet. I hated the way they committed suicide over each other, and how Juliet picked Romeo over actually having a life even though being with Romeo meant suicide. Therefore, it's not to hard to figure out that I wasn't all too fond of this.
 
 I actually don't know who I pity more: me, for reading this book when Chinese water torture might have been preferable, the editor for having to fix it from whatever level of absolute hopelessness it was in to the level of suckiness that it became, or Bella whose love left her (a sign to get over them to anyone reading this- don't wallow over some idiot) and was adament about their inexistent future together in the first place. Hm. Real tuffie. I don't know if me or the editor had it worse. 
 
 What about Bella? Who cares, she was an idiot. 
 
 And if love makes people fools, then it's not all its cracked up to be and I'm fine being single.
