<REVIEW>
I own all of the current major consoles, PS3, XBOX 360 and Wii.  They all have their pluses and minuses and my feelings for the PS3 is that its a a great BluRay player but I have no love for it as game system.  All of my family uses the Wii, we own 2 XBOX 360s due to my kids and myself wanting to play it but the PS3 only gets used for movies.  I originally planned to use it as a second game system but there are few originals while the XBOX has tons of exclusives not availble for PS3(Halo, Gears of War, Forza, Mass Effect etc).  But the biggest drawback for me personally is that the PS3 controller is the same size and design as the one introduced 15 years ago on the original Playstation.  Sure, its wireless now but its too small and not ergonomic(unless you are a child or chimpanzee).  The new slimline is slightly nicer than the old toaster but it is still not stackable due to its curved case.  For some reason Sony thinks the Playstation needs to handle well in wind tunnels.  The "sleek" design may come in handy when I toss it out the window to replace with a normal Bluray player. So in short if you want a Bluray player, buy a Bluray player, if you want a great game system, buy an XBOX, and if you want a spoiler for your car, buy a PS3.
