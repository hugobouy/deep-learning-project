<REVIEW>
Okay, I've read the other reviews that call this publication shallow, lacking in depth, geared toward young teenagers, etc.  I guess if you are looking for twenty page, in-depth technical articles that delve into every minute neutron of a particular subject, then yes, this publication might not be what you're looking for.
 
 But, if you're a regular, average, ordinary guy like me (who would not understand those deep, brainy articles anyway) and you are looking for an entertaining, informative view onto what's new and what's cool, I think you'll be pleased.  Very pleased! 
 
 Take, for example, a couple of recent issues (see the date of when this review was written).  Last month was focused on the future of personal aviation and the people behind the effort to make personal flight more available and affordable, and about the aircrafts they are inventing.  Fascinating!  Now, can I run out and build myself a prototype after reading the articles?  Ummm, no.  Do I know a whole lot more about an incredibly fun subject then I did before?  Yes!
 
 This month's issue focuses on similar theme: The future of personal space travel and the idea of a space-hotel.  When you're done reading it will you be able to build a rocket and fly to the moon?  Of course not.  But it's informative and educational to the exact level I would want it to be... just enough to make me aware, enlightened, and entertained.
 
 So to all the non-nerds, non-rocket scientists, and non-brainiacs who want a scientific publication by the people, for the people, I think your yearly subscription money will be well spent.
 
 Enjoy!
