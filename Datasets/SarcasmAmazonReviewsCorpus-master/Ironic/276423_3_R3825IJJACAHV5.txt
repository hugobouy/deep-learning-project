<REVIEW>
Don't let the picture fool you, these shoes DO NOT make you jump as high as the moon.  In fact, even the most highly-trained athlete wearing these shoes would only be able to jump as high as the clouds.   While gravity and shoddy craftsmanship might limit your jumping potential, your imagination will allow you to leap to the stars!  That's the best part about Black Moon Shoes -- it's not about how high you can or can't jump -- it's about how high you WANT to jump.   So when it comes to using your imagination and developing important motor skills, Hart Enterprises' Black Moon Shoes are leaps and bounds above the competition.
