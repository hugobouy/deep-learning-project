<REVIEW>
Awkward sentences, conspiratorial, deluded and poorly developed, a patronisingly didactic tone and poor character development. Those are just a few of its virtues or flaws depending whether you have the fortune of literacy and the gift of sight or the gift of hearing should you decide to have this masterpiece read to you.
 
 I recommend this to the homeless, it'll inspire jealousy when they realise there's a market for conspiracy, and to the people I don't like.
