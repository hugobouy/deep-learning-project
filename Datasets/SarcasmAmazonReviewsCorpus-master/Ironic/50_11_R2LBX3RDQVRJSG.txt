<REVIEW>
I had high hopes for this book, if for nothing else, then as a chuckle-inducing bathroom read. 
 
 I must say, I was gravely disappointed. The book literally did not elicit a single laugh from me, and most of the "suggestions" would only lead to you quickly becoming the supreme village idiot. The only reason I read the entire book was because I just had to know HOW bad this book could get. Quite bad, indeed, it reminds of a train wreck: so bad you just can't look away. 
 
 Now, I consider my self to have quite the sense of humor, yet this book just did not deliver on any level. If you consider yourself levelheaded, I'm sure you will agree. 
 
 If you want to read some real good chaff, go ahead and get this book. My copy is in the trash. I'm ashamed to have owned it.
