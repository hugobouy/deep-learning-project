<REVIEW>
Everything is bad in this movie.....where should I start with?
 
 1-EXTREMLY LONG!...the "climax" of the movie is like a torture, a normal lenght will be 10 ro 15 minutes, but in this one is like 40-50!!! and all because the stupid Autobots dropped Sam 25km away from Optimus spare parts!! I mean....could they be more stupid?? They could have left him near, but NO, it was a battle field, and he was defenseless.
 
 2-TOO MUCH COMEDY - Parents, twin robots, bumblebee,fat computer nerds, conspirancy crazy guy....little decepticons....dumb giant robots.....Its amazing but the list can go on and on!!...arrogant teacher from THE OFFICE....Totally stupid! And there wasnt a single fun joke or scene between all this characters, in fact their attempts were so lame it was pathetic.
 
 3-SQUARED CHARACTERS - No need to explain, all characters are robots (including humans) all predictable, all cliche, all repetitive.
 
 4-THE CONSPIRANCY WAKO GIVING ORDERS TO THE ARMY - WTF??? Since when a civilian gives orders to the armada for using a secret weapon???
 
 5-THE FLASHBACK OF THE MACHINE - we can see how the old autobots were having their AA meetings, and lots of caveman around it..and it was all surrounded by mountains....turns out thats Egypt...ya...there are so many mountains on Egypt today.
 
 I could keep forever, but I erased from my memory most of the stupidities I saw, this are the worst that cannot be removed, and will torture me for the rest of my life.
