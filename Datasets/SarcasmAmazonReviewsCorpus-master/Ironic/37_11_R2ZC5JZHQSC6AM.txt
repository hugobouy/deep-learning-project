<REVIEW>
Paris Hilton again amazes the audience with a truly masterful performance. she shows us why she has the determination and the talent to become one of Hollywood's finest actresses. 
 
 next, i'd like to congratulate tom Putnam for showing us that he has the leadership and skill to rise among the ranks of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.
 
 i can't remember the last time i laughed throughout the entirety of a film. this movie gets two big thumbs up for originality, and the best acting in 2008 so far. move aside Indiana Jones, make way for one of the all time greats in the movie industry. 
 
 cheers Paris
