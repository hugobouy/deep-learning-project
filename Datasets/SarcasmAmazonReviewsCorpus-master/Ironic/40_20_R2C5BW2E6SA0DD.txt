<REVIEW>
I am a tortured soul...No one understands me...my dad and mom force me to clean my room, force me to do my homework...etc., etc...woe is me...I listen to korn to get me through the long, harsh days of high school/junior high, and to get me through the long nights of my parents making me do my homework...the only people that understand me are in the band korn...
 
 Seriously though, I don't understand why this album is praised so much.  What did it do for anybody besides making 15 year old, zit faced kids depressed (for the most part), and the execs. who marketed this product so brilliantly?  Some argue that this album pioneered a wave of new music.  Even though this is somewhat (not entirely) true, what did it pioneer??? It pioneered Nu-Metal...hands down one of the worst genre's of music (with the exception of a few bands).
 
 I really don't care about metal having controversial lyrics for the most part, I like to consider myself open-minded when it comes to music, but this album, and ALL of korn's subsequent albums after this, have the same stupid lyrics/themes over, and over again.  Mom didn't love me, Dad did thing's to me, no one understands me, why me?, etc.., etc.  This has been going on for 10+ years.  They would probably be more respectable if they got a new topic/theme.  Davis though, who I assume writes the lyrics, has a lot to complain about.  He's a multi-millionaire, has legions of fans/easy women,..etc., etc.....No wonder he is so depressed (note sarcasm).  
 
 Korn also do not have much talent at all.  The vocals are equivalent to the sound someone makes when he/she gets shot in the ass.  Davis really needs to take singing lessons.  The guitarists are just plain bad and they pretty much use no more than three power chords in each song...In fact, why were there 2 guitarists in this band???  The bass sounds awful, and I don't care for the drums. 
 
 In all though, this album was never good.  Try to check out some other worthwhile music that actually means something, and whose band members actually have talent.  For real music check out Opeth, Meshuggah, King's X, Dream Theater, Porcupine Tree, Symphony X, to name a few.
