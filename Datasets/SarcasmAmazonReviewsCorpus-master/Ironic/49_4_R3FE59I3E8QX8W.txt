<REVIEW>
What an awesome idea for a childs toy.
 I bought one for my niece, wanting to instill the proper values in her starting at a young age.
 This baby doesn't cry, doesn't eat.
 All it wants is a smoke.
 And what's wrong with that?
 By the time I get home from another hellish day at the office that's all I want.
 Why not start early and learn those addictive coping habits before they get old enough to rebel.
 Now, if the company can just come out with one more baby.
 The others are coke baby, this one comes with a straw and a mirror.
 Heroin baby, comes with it's own set of syringes.
 And of course weed baby that comes with a huge blunt.
 The only one we're missing is crack/meth baby that comes with it's own pipes and is missing half it's head and an eye.
 Now THAT is one toy my niece cannot go without.
 Anyway....the smoking baby is fun, educational, and a must have.
 And in case you really are that stupid, yes this review is a joke.
 Lighten up.
 Or in this case....light up. :)
