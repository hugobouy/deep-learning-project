<REVIEW>
It's all about the characters! It's not about answering any of the questions that were teasingly introduced for 5 years. It's all about, you know, who winds up shagging who, just like every other vapid soap opera on tv. I mean come on people, do you REALLY care what the island was supposed to be in the end? Isn't the intellectual thrill ride that is the Jack/Kate/Sawyer/Juliet relationship roller coaster far better to have all the answers to? And I know I know, the flash sideways had nothing, absolutely nothing to do with anything that happened in the first 5 seasons of LOST, nor did they have anything to do with anything that happened on the island or to the characters while they were alive, but aren't you glad to finally, at the end of this 6 season saga, find out what they were really all about?
 
 Season 6 is a classic example of the bait and switch, or of, wait for it... The Long Con! You know, the title of one of the earlier episodes! See!? They DID know where they were going with this show all along!
 
 Sheesh.
