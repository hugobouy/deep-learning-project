<REVIEW>
I am now waiting on my second seat and car seat adaptor for months. I have written baby jogger 3 times now. They do not respond. This is just plain ridiculous. It now says on sites like Amazon that it will be late May before they ship. How can a company that ships baby products have such delays. By the time we get the car seat adaptor my daughter (already born last month) will no longer need it.
