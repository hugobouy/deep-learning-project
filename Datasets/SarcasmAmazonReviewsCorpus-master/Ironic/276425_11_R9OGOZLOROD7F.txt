Looking for a spooky tale to curl up to this Halloween season?  Is there a glaring gap between your Stephen King and Anne Rice books on the shelf?  Here's the perfect horror novel to plug it with!
 
 A supernatural thriller to the core, the monster in this book will thrill and chill you! A demonic entity named Yahweh sets humanity up with the perfect trap: the Tree of Life. Knowing they'll eat the otherwise purposeless fruit, he slaps them with a generational curse that binds them to his malevolent will!  What follows is the most twisted tale of evil ever written! Yahweh, egotistical and ragingly jealous, uses those under his control to rape and pillage cultures that don't worship him.  Men, women and animals alike were slain in these bloodthirsty raids.  The only hope you had was being a virgin woman whom Yahweh encourages to be conquested [Deuteronomy 21:10-13], [Deuteronomy 20:13-16].
 
 If you have a hard time reading about cruel animal and human sacrifices, perverted sexual references and the murder and abuse of children I suggest not picking this up.  This is a true tale of horror and our villian is far from tactful!  However, Yahweh's not a transparent, homocidal manaic.  To be so would be far too predictable and I commend the author on his skillful character development.  What makes Yahweh so fiendish is that he commits his violent acts under the veneer of love! To fool humanity futher he sent down a hippy version of himself and later set that person up to die, quenching his bloodlust once again.  But, that's not where the horror ends!  I hate to give away the ending but it's far too devious to go unmentioned!  In the end his cult followers will be sucked  into an alternative dimension where they will toil and praise his ego to neverending extents.  Those who choose not to accept his conditional, unconditional love will find themselves in a sadistic torture pit of his making.
 
 What's really neat about this work of fiction is you don't even have to pay for it!  There's many fan bases out there that will happily provide you with a copy!
