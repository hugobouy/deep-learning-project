No way, Bra!
 Tim and Eric is a whack rip off of the Jim and Derrick show, fool. Let me break it down for you, yo. Jim and Derrick be hella tight , yo. And stuff. Like hot chicks and hella mad whacks! Suck, swallow, release! Beahhtch! I saw Derrick Whipple in da flesh at Turbo Fuel Skatepark in Frisco, yo. He was doing mad tricks and hos, yo. That skit with the bunny and the honey had me cryin', yo. Fools always be tryin to git out of payin up, you know, yo. Bra. Anyway, I gotta run dawgs. I gotta go smoke outta my new pipe I just got for my 13th birfday. Me and my boy, tony, are gonna head down to brown town and find some herb and rolos. Peace, bra. Oh no you didn't! ha ha! Peace. You just got reviewed!
