<PRODUCT>Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! - Season 1 (DVD)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
Seldom a product comes around that arouses the senses in the way Tim and Eric Awesome Show: Great Job! does. When enjoying the show with my many coworkers and pets, I can't help but remember the great summer of 1993. For me, and many others, this is a return to the boldness yesteryear. It is a series that presents as many questions as it offers answers, sharing the joys of shrimp, sports and Bluetooth(tm) Technology with hundreds of millions of people across the globe.
 
 Are Tim and Eric guide you like a Euchaetes egle? Maybe not.
 Could Richard Dunn be the next Dick Van Dyke? Perhaps on a perchance.
 Does David Liebe Heart tear at your heartstrings every time he opens his beautifully shaped mouth? A thousand times, yes.
 
 Truly this 5-star cast will have you laughing as well as thinking within the first opening. Combine this with hundreds of celebrity guest appearances ranging from Oscar-winning Billy Crystals to music superstar DJ Douggpound and the viewer will have a euphoric experience presented in Digital Video Disk quality.
