<REVIEW>
First off its an inanimate electronic device nothing more. 
 Save your passion and love for the PEOPLE in your life should you be so blessed. 
 
 No USB 
 No SD Slot 
 No Security software 
 No Camera or Video 
 No Tethering to anything 
 No Voice Recorder 
 No Calculator 
 No Weather 
 No Flash 
 
 Not a true user configurable tablet PC nor is it a true user friendly portable device (Room to Room) does not count. 
 It is a considerably dumbed down, denuded and stripped down iphone, iguess with no phone......wow.......how inovative.
 
 Curious, how does it feel to be an unsolicited beta-tester ?
 
 It is also a huge content pig providing considerable additional profit for apple by driving up the cost of ownership skyhigh........ca-ching. 
 App. buy ins could potentially soar into hundreds of dollars again rasing the cost of ownership...........ca-ching. 
 
 USB was specifically excluded to prevent users from connecting 3G broadband devices from providers other than at&t.........can you spell verizon ? 
 
 Any well configured HD notebook will leave this Gen-1 tablet in the dust and for similar dollars. 
 
 A failed attempt at being the first on the block with the newest thing mentality by Obi-Wan Jobs 
 and this from the same genuises who brought their customer base the NEWTON.
 
 You apple weenies got seriously hosed.
 
 Read and weep......"Engadget also suggested said that the next-gen Apple TV will essentially be an iPad without a screen, using the SAME HARDWARE, including the CPU OS, and 16-Gbytes of flash memory. To accommodate the smaller storage, Apple will EMPHASISE STREAMING CONTENT the report said".
 
 All that and more for only $99 bucks.....wow.....talk about getting screwed out of the contents of ones wallet.
 
 Thats nothing, wait till the 2nd Gen ipad, better configured and cheaper hits the stores for xmas.
 
 Apple-ites will be jumping out of their starbucks windows....eh !
 
 Furthermore from the august pages of  the "No news is good news" dept.
 
 AT&t in partnership (co-conspirators) with snapple, royal screws its customer base.....again.
 
 Read on; [...]
