<REVIEW>
I have to admit that i have never laughed that hard after seeing a movie then i did when i saw this one. I was laughing out loud because this film reminded me of the crap my proffesors used to make the class watch on "the evil of america" and "taking down greed". Such comical propoganda devices that resembled those used in the 1950s, only instead of targeting communism they target american business. The lies in this film were so blatant that i felt like i was watching MSNBC or Fox. As a third generation cuban, my great grandmother was cubano, it was rather insulting to show cuba as this garden of eden for equality and freedom.But i eventually got over this because you cant let blatant lies and propoganda get you down otherwise the bullies in our culture like Mr. Moore win. If there is anyone that actually believes that Cuba has an admirable, free, health care system let me state some facts gathered from actuall cuban doctors and patients who managed to escape. 
 
 -IF there is a complication with the fetus of a pregnant woman the government forces an abortion.
 -If a child dies soon after birth the doctor will not record it as ever having lived at all (remember when moore stated that cuba enjoys a lower infant mortality rate? well there you go. thats the reason.)
 -That UN survey that states cuba as having a better health care system than us is on the survey, however the UN does not investigate countrie's health care systems, they simply take down whatever the country decides to report. Hmmmm....why should we believe what a communist dictator has to say about his own country?
 -Smuggled pictures show dilapidated hospitals, patients who are dying of starvation, neglect, and infection. 
 
 Those people that Moore shows in his film that have the high medical bills, you know the ones that are the helpless victims of our "disgusting, greed driven society". You will notice that all the people are middle class individuals with big screen tvs, 3 cars in the driveway, and an outstanding mortgage for a house that they cannot afford. Hmmmmm.....and im supposed to feel sorry for their utter stupidity and lack of regard for their own responsibility? Why is it that in this country people will pay $6 for a cup of coffee, and $50 for a videogame, but when it comes to their healthcare its simply "too expensive" and somehow the fault of "greedy businessmen". Maybe Moore should make a film about prioritization in america. About those people that throw their money away on material possessions but when their bills finally catch up with them they declare bankruptcy. It is trully a unique society we live in. their is such an utter disregard for responsibility and so many avenues and entitlement programs to cover your ass with.
