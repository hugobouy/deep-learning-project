<REVIEW>
If Tori Spelling ever had anything remotely interesting on her mind (which is debatable), she has now officially run out of thoughts. Her third book "Uncharted TerriTORI" is an exercise in vapidity, in which Spelling disingenuously rambles on about the exact same subjects that her previous books were about -- and honestly, she usually comes across as a spoiled brat playing at being a grown-up.
 
 A lot of her essays are on pretty mundane events -- meeting her hubby's understandably bitter ex-wife, the woes of motherhood, family vacations, stress, clinginess towards friends, jury duty, meeting her grandparents, her son's first day at school, swine flu, and so on. In the hands of a more self-aware person this wouldn't be a problem, but Spelling acts as if she is literally the first person to ever experience these things.
 
 And she rambles about far less mundane things: what meanies the 90210 cast are (according to her, she was the "sweet" one and they should just LOVE her), sex in a hospital bed, overcoming the paparazzi, starring in a reality show, the terrors of staying at a cheap motel, and adopting a pig. Plus, she tries to overcome her aviatophobia by going to a psychic AND a past-life specialist, and tries to cure headaches with voodoo BEFORE consulting a doctor. Only in L.A., people.
 
 "Uncharted TerriTORI" is basically a big puff pastry, filled with air and flakes -- and reading it is a lot like listening to someone nattering about the minutiae of their uninteresting life. Tori Spelling seems to have two modes of thought: either she is desperately trying to convince us that she's "just people" or she's dissecting mundane events and blowing them WILDLY out of proportion. 
 
 So unsurprisingly, a lot of "Uncharted TerriTORI" is painfully boring, as Spelling either does boring stuff or contemplates her own surgically-enhanced navel. The entire book is written in a coyly disingenuous style, with all the boring stuff only broken by moments of unintentionally hilarious melodrama -- just look at the scene where Spelling's husband rips out her IV and carries her (soap opera style) through the hospital, yelling for doctors. Who can take that seriously?
 
 Spelling herself doesn't come across too well -- she seems pampered, clingy, whiny, and laughably entitled ("Maybe I was born into wealth as punishment for my behavior asn an Egyptian pharoah"). Additionally, her obsession with herself (a whole chapter on TWEETING!) is just painful. And though she spends a LOT of time trying to convince us that her marriage is not "loveless" as the tabloids say, her husband comes across as a manipulative creep who is just tolerating her.
 
 "Uncharted TerriTORI" is an exercise in tedium, similar to dragging yourself across a very long bed of nails -- boring, painful and seemingly never over.
