If you're looking for REAL heavy metal and if you are sick of that old fake crap (Megadeth, Dream Theater, 80s Metallica, Iron Maiden, Opeth, Queensryche, Borknagar etc - basically any of the clowns that only posers with no taste praise) then look no further. They show other talentless poser "metal" bands that solos suck and when they actually do solo - they do it better than any of those losers in the 80s. They show unknown posers with guitars like Malmsteen, Satriani, McLaughlin, Michael Romeo etc how to REALLY play an instrument. When I listen to this I feel soooooo deep. Like Amy lee, I am a tortured artist and too complicated and intelligent for the world to understand. That's why I'm anti-authority and anti-mainstream. Thankfully MTV caters to rebels such as myself.  
 
 LONG LIVE METAL!!!!1
