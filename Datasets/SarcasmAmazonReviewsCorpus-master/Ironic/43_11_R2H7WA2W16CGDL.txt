Wow what a way to start off your career with one of the best debut albums ever! This album is non-stop rock. And I don't mean fake rock such as The Who or Led Zeppelin; I mean stuff that actually takes TALENT to creat (those guys were just hippies on acid trips who have no ability to create good music). Ashlee can play instuments for the record, I've even seen a picture of her with a guitar which proves it. She composed this music ON HER OWN and didn't just touch up her voice in the studio like these posers will tell you. Also you bitch about her lip synching. Well LOL everybody does it LOL. You should get this, but ignore talentless poser "singers" such as Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo.
