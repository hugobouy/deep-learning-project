<REVIEW>
What can one possibly say that isn't self explanatory?
 
 Just as it looks - Band-Aids that look like bacon.
 Cool enough in it's own right.
 
 I've been sitting here just *waiting* to cut myself just so I can slap one of these bad boys on, to the envy of all friends and coworkers.
 There's no doubt that a slab of bacon will heal any wound.
 
 Comes w/ "free toy" too - a tiny little piglet figurine. How demented is that.
