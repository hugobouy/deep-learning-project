<REVIEW>
This book is a classic..... by what criteria, however, is beyond me. The foremost impression it gives is that of an oppressive tedium. Read fifty pages, you'll be bored. Read fifty more, you will surely feel your brain turning to lead. If there are any real characters under the absolutely arbitrary routines of the wretchedly two dimensional people who populate this book, well then they are buried under the crushing weight of circularly formatted lists chronicling the daily activities of these fickle, unmotivated drunks with no imaginations. Who happen to be getting bored and drunk in pretty places. Trust me, absolutely nothing happens, WHATSOEVER.
 
 The lost generation this may have been. Judging by this book, what they really were missing was personality, a sense of purpose, and the ability to conceive of even a single shred of worthwhile, memorable drama. Lost all right. I dare you to try and read this and not lose your mind.
