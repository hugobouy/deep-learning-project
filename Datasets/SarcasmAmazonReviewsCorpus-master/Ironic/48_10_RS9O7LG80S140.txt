<REVIEW>
The writing gets worse in the Twilight saga.  It makes VC Andrews (if you are old enough to remember those books) read like high literary prose.  But what teenaged girl can resist this plot of an unearthly gorgeous vampire (who is also wildly rich) in love with a mortal girl dealing with high school?  Apparently not many.
