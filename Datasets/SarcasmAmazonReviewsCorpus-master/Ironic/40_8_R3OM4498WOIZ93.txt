The secret to become rich is easy, Make a none working(windows) product which is none existent(virtual)and make
 all who use it to pay multiple times for the same product(dont provide bootdiscs,instead embedded chips). O I allmost forgot the most important thing you need immunity from the government(s), in order to continue to billionaire status. Bill did it over and over again and here it is again. Tatataaaaa Vista 7, oops sorry Windows 7. To be continued with Window 8 next year spring hahaha..
