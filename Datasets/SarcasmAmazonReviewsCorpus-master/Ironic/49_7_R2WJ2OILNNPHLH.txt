<REVIEW>
I bought this camera for my deployment to Iraq.  It was in my cargo pants pocket one day I took it out and the lens was cracked and the silver trim ring had fallen off.  I don't know how it broke but it did.  Anyways when I got home I contacted Kodak to fix it.  They said "Customer induced damage to the camera voids the warranty" they want $63 + $10.95 + tax to fix it OR I can send it to them and they will take 15% off a new camera if bought from the Kodak store.  No thanks, first and last time I'll buy a Kodak camera.  It's going to be a nice paperweight.
