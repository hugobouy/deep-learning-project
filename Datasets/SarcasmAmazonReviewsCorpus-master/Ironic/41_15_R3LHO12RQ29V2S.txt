<REVIEW>
I don't know what kind of hair this trimmer is supposed to cut, but it don't cut mine.  You can stick it in your nose until the battery dies (which actually is not such a long time), and you won't cut as much hair as you could with a pair of scissors in 10 seconds.  There's just no comparison.  This trimmer makes a lot of noise and painfully tugs on hairs, but it's all sound and fury.  Nothing much happens.  So, I'd say that unless you have tremors or something, you'd be much better off with a $3-pair of manicure scissors.  Do the job in 10 seconds.
