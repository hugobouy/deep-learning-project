<REVIEW>
This is a serious review.  I've spent 13 of the last 15 months defending freedom as a U.S. soldier serving in Iraq.  My friends just sent me a care package which included Three Wolf Moon (size Medium).  When I took it from the box I didn't know anything about the shirt's magic powers or special abilities, but I immediately recognized it as the sweetest graphic I've ever seen printed on fabric.  I was shocked when I was showing it off and a fellow member of my company identified TWM as a cultural phenomenon/enchanted garment.  To know that my friends loved me enough to send me a t-shirt that one reviewer described as being "woven from the same material as Chuck Norris' beard" made my heart leap.  Repeated reviewers described TWM's abilities to stop bullets and resist flame. Being that I still have three months left of my tour here - and based on the recommendations of my fellow amazon.com shoppers - I will be replacing my body armor with TWM.  I feel that not only will TWM provide me with better ballistic protection, but it will also be much cooler during the upcoming summer heat.  Thank you wolf pack, thank you amazon.com, and thank you Three Wolf Moon.
