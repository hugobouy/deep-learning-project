<PRODUCT>How to Defend Yourself Against Alien Abduction (Paperback)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
As a Grey, I found this book to be entirely slanderous of me and my people and our mission on Earth. We are not here to "abduct" you, perform horrible experiments and make you doubt the reality of your own petty, wormlike existences. We are here as mere researchers, trying to discover what it is about humanity that makes you so... special. If the advice in this book were to be taken, why, our research would come to a complete standstill! Without subjects to study, how can we know more about you and your inconsequential lives? We are on your planet for entirely peaceful reasons, and not - I repeat NOT - here to steal your genetic material to build an invincible army to utterly annihilate those crustaceous scum on Alpha Centauri.
 
 What's more, it would completely mess up the fourth season of "Who Wants to Be an Earthling," and you really don't want to screw with the networks like that.
 
 Don't buy this book! Think about the bigger picture!
