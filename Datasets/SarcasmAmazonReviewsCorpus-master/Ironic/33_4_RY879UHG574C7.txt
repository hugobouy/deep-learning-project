<REVIEW>
I was searching for clothes that speak to me.. These pants not only spoke to me, they entered my soul and transformed me.  When I get out of my bitchin 78 camaro wearing these bad boys, there's no question who the boss man is.. 
     You can easily go commando in these and feel even more manly.  Your junk swings freely and using the restroom is that much easier.. 
 Accessories to consider:
 Flannel shirt with the sleeves cut off.  The "don't mess with me" look.
 flip flops - The casual "I'm too lazy to get fully dressed" look.
 baseball helmet with two beer can holders on the sides.
 Ball cap worn backwards or to the side. You know I'm coooool.
      These pants will get the ladies.  There are many many places these can be worn to attract the female species:
 Tractor pull
 Walmart
 NASCAR events
 Your local neighborhood crack houses. 
 The drug rehab rec room
 Any place in the state of IOWA.
 
 I recommend buying multiple pairs. Keep an extra pair in the trunk of your car.. You never know where you will wake up in the morning but you will always have a clean pair of these bad boys with you..
