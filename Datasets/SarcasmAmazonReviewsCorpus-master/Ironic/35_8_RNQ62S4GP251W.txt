Like any profession the burglary profession has bit hit hard by the recession. People just don't buy luxury goods anymore and when they do they tend to protect these assets with more care, i.e. dogs, guns, security alarms. First and foremost, notice the matte finish-- for burglars beyond the amateur level matte finish is essential. I know there are some flashy cat burglars that take a lot of joy in a gloss coat but for us ninja-type burglars we want to get in and get out as quickly and painlessly as possible. That means, low profile matte finish burgling tools like this. 
 
 Second, alarms. I have em' in my house-- what a pain huh? Your kid or dog sets em' off. You're trying to do your job robbing a house and you get a call from Brinks to say that it appears you have a break in, then your kid calls, can't remember the code to switch it off, and you're arguing with the Brinks guy in the middle of your job while you're trying to kill the alarm from the outside. The crow bar hinge on the end of this blade is great for breaking to security boxes and cutting the power. After that the only real tough part is bonking the dog on the head with its solid handle and making a mad dash for the goods. I've only had one time where I've really had to use the blade-- look-- the guy had a gun! All I did was swing the blade nice and quick, off goes the hand and I was out of the house with the goods. EASY. 10 stars for this self-defense/burglar blade. Really do yourself a favor and pick-up one before you go "shopping" for some of your neighbors goods.
