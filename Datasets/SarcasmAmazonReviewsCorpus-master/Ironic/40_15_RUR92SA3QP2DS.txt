<REVIEW>
The Lt. Colonel-author's book is published by the Regnery comp. that is devoted to philippics about Bill Clinton especially, and anything Democratic in general.  The author had no particularly important administrative role to the Clinton foreign or military policy development other than tagging along with the president, but he seems to consider this chore as making him as knowledgeable as Kissinger, Dulles, or Gen. Marshall in knowing what decisions should be made.   Facts were not much of a concern to this author.  Never mind that Bush I began the Somalia affair, and the reduction of military.  Or that the Republicans controlled the Congress and assisted in the reduction of the military bases under Clinton.  Also, if it was so easy to get Bin Laden, then why after sending an entire army for him has the current president still not found the guy?  And did I mention that the author was merely a tag along.  I understand that he is planning a sequel on the mismanagement of McDonalds restaurant (hey, he buys happy meals, what more does he need to know). I didn't purchase the book, so Regnery made no money off me.  But, I will consider a book by them on the revelations of the Clinton's White House gardener, or pastry chef when those books become available.  I'll bet you that Bill once callously pulled a petal off a rose in the White House garden, and you can only imagine what he did with the custard from the White House eclairs!!
