<REVIEW>
This is a very clever book on developing speed reading.  The author disguised it as a nonfiction account of the "liberal" news media, but as I discovered, if you only read the pages in which the author provides verifiable facts to support his reasoning, then you can finish the book before moving from the library book shelf.  Imagine, two hundred pages in five minutes!  I almost got finger blisters turning the pages so quickly. I learned years ago in college that when reading a non-fiction book, other than, let's say, most memoirs, that if the book is without reference materials, a bibliography, or notes that allows the reader to verify the information, then the book is most likely a sham.   "Bias" has zero references that would allow the curious reader to independently authenticate the writer's claims.  I also did not notice at least semi-complete transcripts to allow for the writer's alleged quotes to be understood in context.  The author is strictly operating on a "trust me" basis.  If that's good enough for you, then I have a 70's VW to sell you (only driven once, really would I lie!).   Regardless of your political orientation, the author should desire an intelligent audience.  By stating his views as proven facts, the author violates the trust given by his audience to treat them with intellectual respect.  Another book, "What Liberal Media?  The Truth About Bias and the News" by Eric Alterman, actually considers the accusations of the Bias author and finds the claims lacking substance.  Sure, Alterman is a liberal, but he gives a full forty pages of references (roughly a fifth of the Bias book's total pages) to back up his claims, and to allow the reader to look for her/himself.  In sum, if you want to know who is "Biased" consider who is preferring to hide the information vs. who gives it to you to make up your own mind.  I don't have to agree with all of Alterman's conclusions, but at least he gives me the opportunity to judge the facts on my own.
