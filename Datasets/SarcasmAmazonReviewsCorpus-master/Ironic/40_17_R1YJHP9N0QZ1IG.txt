<REVIEW>
I found this movie to be an incredibly stupid incoherent mess of scenes and CGI. I didn't get anything out of this movie except a couple laughs. My main problem is how unrealistic this movie is. In the first place you have Susie Salmon played by Saoirse Ronan who is a gullible girl in whom it's obvious her parents didn't teach her anything because she stupidly follows the neighborhood pedophile played by Stanley Tucci into some makeshift underground room/pedo-shrine where she gets raped and murdered by the psycho. Then it becomes even more disturbing when her soul gets transported to her very own cheesy CGI version of pergatory where she is able to go sledding on top of fake CG snowy mountains, dance like a hippy in front of a fake CG city (I cringed at that part) and she even becomes friends with a random victim of the same pedophile on the other side she then shoots the @#$# with. This movie has a disturbing undertone and sends the wrong message that she is better off being raped and killed just so long as when it's all said and done she can be transported to her own little wonderland of fun.
 
  The movie then wants you to think that she can help her parents solve her murder but it becomes a useless plot line and nothing really becomes of it. Jack Salmon who is the father of Susie Salmon (played by Mark Wahlberg) basically transforms into a paranoid wreck because of the murder to the point of wanting the police to randomly investigate hundreds of people/neighbors on suspicion of murder without one single shred of proof. As if this wasn't laughable enough, Susie Salmon's little sister Lindsey Salmon is walking her dog after the murder and when she stops in front of the pedophile's house the dog begins to bark at it and this is apparently all the proof the Salmon family needs to know that the he's the guy that is responsible for the murder (lol). At this point the movie becomes ridiculous when Jack Salmon tails the pedophile with a baseball bat into a corn field for some revenge only to stumble onto a pair of high school lovers which results in Jack Salmon getting his ass kicked by a jock with his own bat no less which earns him a trip to the hospital. I can go on and on but I'll end this review by saying the movie reaches it's conclusion with the murder being unsolved; the presumption that it's okay to break into a person's house to obtain evidence; Susie Salmon ridiculously manifesting herself into the body of another girl order to obtain a kiss from a five minute crush whom she met at the start of the movie; a random miniature icicle brings ultimate justice when it falls on the pedophile with the force of a soft teddy bear causing him thus to fall off a cliff (lol). Thank heaven this was only a $1 rental.  Since this movie is asinine to the tenth degree treat it like the plague and run, you'll be doing you and your family a favor. I'd imagine only a narcotics addict would find this movie remotely interesting.
