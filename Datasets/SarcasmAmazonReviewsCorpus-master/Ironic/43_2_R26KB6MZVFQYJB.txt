<REVIEW>
This is truly a spectacular movie in the tradition of Showgirls and Battlefield Earth.  It is one of those movies in which you know the people both on and off screen actually THINK they are making a quality product, but the result is so horrifying as to make it magnificent. Everything about this movie, including, but not limited to, the cheesy and overdone soundtrack (minor key, I should feel sad right now), the horribly written dialog, the wooden delivery (there were a few scenes where I swear Affleck was reading off of a cue card), and the incoherent plot, make this movie one for the ages.  While I don't think it really deserves it's current position as #1 on the top 100 worst films of all time on IMDB, it is definitely in the top 10.   I saw it in the theater with about 6 other people and we all could not stop laughing.  Truly a trainwreck of a movie.
