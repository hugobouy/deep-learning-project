<REVIEW>
Make no mistake, this is a candy bar masquarading as a nutrition bar.  With whopping 9 grams of sugar ( 45 calories ) almost 1/3 of the calories in total, you'll have a much more pleasant experience having a small candy bar.  I found the taste and texture so awful I had to spit it out.  To the delight of my squirrel friends, I tossed the rest of the bar outside where they promptly gobbled it up.  This is a gimmick created by this Dr. for cash purposes.  If he's such a great diet Dr., why doesn't he recommend you eat plain nuts?  An apple?  A yogurt?  There is nothing magical about this bar - eat ANYTHING that contains 170 calories with a glass of water a half hour before your meal and you'll probably be just as full.
