<REVIEW>
Sorry to see Charlaine Harris join the list of writers who are so driven by deadline pressure they can't create.  Remember what we all learned in elementary school, faced with that blank sheet of paper?  You can't just order up creativity and expect it to be good.  This is the third one of my favorite authors with series pressure to dissapoint.  Beware when an author thanks so many other people for their "help"!  Last time I looked, most great fiction was not written by a committee.  Harris is brilliant, when Harris is writing.  This looked like an outline, with some help from Harris and a lot of suggestions from other people.  People saying, write about Alcide.  Write about politics.  Write about fairy politics, etc.  There is no plot, no main conflict, no main resolution, no basic novel elements.  And we know Harris can write one hell of a plot when she is on her game.  I would rather the publisher just said "Harris has writer's block" than churn out this overpriced drivel with her name on it.  I would be willing to wait.  And tell the darn committee to leave her alone.
