<PRODUCT>Hell to Pay: The Unfolding Story of Hillary Rodham Clinton (Hardcover)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
More contemptable garbage from the likes of another extreme Conservative.  The majority of the book doesn't even contain facts.  It reads more like a trashy magazine with the same amount of false allegations that themselves amount to nothing.  Perhaps a revised copy of the book should be released and retitled:  Hell to Pay:  The Same Old Right-Wing Story of SENATOR Hillary Rodham Clinton.
