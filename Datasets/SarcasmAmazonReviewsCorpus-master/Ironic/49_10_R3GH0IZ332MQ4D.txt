<REVIEW>
Wouldn't this be the greatest buy in the world?  I ordered one just to see what would happen and they told me that it shipped on 2/15/10.  After about a week I emailed them and they confirmed that the packed had shipped on the 15th.  Today 3/8 I received another email saying that it must have been lost in the mail and I got my refund.
 Idon't know what kind of a game they are playing, but there are no winner.
 I was really hoping that one out a thousand chances i would get the unit.  Wishful thinking.
 They still have 93 available.  Best of luck
