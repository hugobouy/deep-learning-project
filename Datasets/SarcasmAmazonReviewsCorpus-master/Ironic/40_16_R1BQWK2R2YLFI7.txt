<REVIEW>
Let me first say that I haven't taken this shirt off since i got it 8 days ago. When i wear this shirt I fell like the incredible hulk on ice skates. Women love it and business has picked up. In this down economy we need all the help we can get and this shirt delivers. 
 
 It also does a great job absorbing body odor. I don't know what will happen once i wash it - but i can only imagine that with a little age and wear on the shirt, my power and grace will be enhanced even more.
