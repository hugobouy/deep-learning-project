<REVIEW>
Bill O'Reilly joins the ranks of people like Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity with "Culture Warrior" in producing a work that huffs and puffs over an America that might only exist in their own minds and the minds of their devoted fans. So let's take "Culture Warrior" seriously for a moment and give O'Reilly the benefit of the doubt: America is currently engaged in a cultrural "war" between conservatives and liberals for the soul of America and the battleground is largely the media (of which O'Reilly is a part of) and anything else considered "popular culture." O'Reilly uses various examples including the opinions of Hollywood figures such as Susan Sarandon, Jay Leno and his favorite, David Letterman. Apparently O'Reilly believes these guys in conjunction with rap music, are a national threat. Like Pat Buchanan's "State Of Emergency," "Culture Warrior" feels more like the worries and observations of someone who is watching history pass by and would like to turn the clock back. O'Reilly caters to the fears and worries of the conservative right by assuring them that we're the "good guys" and that Iraq is a just war(of course Mr. O'Reilly has never served a day in combat or actually participated in an armed conflict). "Culture Warrior" is a surprisingly short book, composed of much material from "The O'Reilly Factor" TV show, so it's not a very serious study to begin with, not because of the length, but because of the detail and quality of the content. At times O'Reilly comes across as one of those old-fashioned preachers who see Satan everywhere and must cast him out of your living room and television set. He taps into typical conservative slogans by using terms like "we need to be warriors," "you gotta fight back," "Islamofascism." He rants and raves about the key points to outdo your "opponent" when debating a "Secular Progressive." Like Buchanan, O'Reilly is shouting for an America that is quickly fading into the past, if it has not already faded. I would think a "Culture Warrior" would realize that cultures change, evolve, for better or worse, nothing stays the same forever. Like Ann Coulter, much of O'Reilly's prose here caters more to the elites in America, with disturbing undertones in the descriptions of "lower class" America. Is Bill O'Reilly really the most qualified voice to critique the merits of Hip Hop music? And haven't we had this same old tired argument since the days of Elvis? "Culture Warrior" is a requiem, a requiem bathed in self-dillusion about a "culture" that probably never existed to begin with. "Culture Warrior" will most likely fade with time as well, and in the future I imagine students will be reading Noam Chomsky to a higher degree than they ever will read Bill O'Reilly.
