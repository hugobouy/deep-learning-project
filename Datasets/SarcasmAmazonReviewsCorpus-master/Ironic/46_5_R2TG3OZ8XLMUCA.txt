<REVIEW>
I originally bought workout pants made out of France's flag, but whenever my workout partner Hans would come over, for some reason they would turn completely white, a breeze would come out of nowhere, and they'd start flapping/waving in his direction.  Weird.
 
 Anyway, since I got these star spangled beauties, I threw the other ones away.  And the best part is, I can wash them in hot water to get them really clean, because these colors don't run.
