<REVIEW>
Austen's supposed satire of the gothic novel is tangled up with what would have been the finest fluff of effeminate fiction -- had anyone else written it.  Austen, however, cannot resist sinking her sharp little claws into  naivete, romance, and (of course, this IS Jane Austen) men.  I will say, it  is the only book of hers that I have ever been able to finish. No one  would want to be quite as stupid as poor Catherine, but we've all been  naive.  Personally, I envy Catherine the ability to be so pure and trusting  with the object of her affection -- as jaded and overeducated a modern  woman as I am, I find myself reading the story with no feeling so strong as  a wish that (after closely and cynically examining him) I could meet a man  with whom I felt free to admire his perfections and flaws as the finest in  the world!  (I'm sure there's one out there.)  I'm sure Miss Austen would  find this proof that I am as contemptibly stupid as Catherine, but when we  kill our inner innocent completely, then we have made life unworth living,  and I pity all the people with whom we live and work. The book would be  much better if it didn't dawdle with condemning feminine sweetness &amp;  innocence &amp; male behavior's apparently universal (to Austen)  unacceptability, particularly in tarring them all with the same brush.  It  would be far better if bereft of the perfunctorily &quot;happy ending&quot;  which is treated in such a way that love and marriage wind up reeking of as  much of Austen's contempt to at least the same degree as Mrs. Radcliffe's  literary crimes. If you want to see this story the way it should be, the  way it's funny, check out the movie (an episode of Masterpiece Theater).   If you want to slurp latte in a windowless cafe and paint your nails black,  buy the whole Jane Austen collection!
