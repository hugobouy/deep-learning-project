If you're sick of fake metal bands with no talent (Megadeth, 80s Metallica, Opeth, Dream Theater, Iron Maiden, Borknagar, Queensryche, etc - basically any of the crap that only posers praise) then you need to get this. They show so-called "metal" bands how to play REAL metal, and also that solos suck. This is MUCH better than anything those losers in the 80s could do. Once again unknown posers with guitars such as Malmsteen, Satriani, McLaughlin, Michael Romeo and Allan Holdsworth are shown how to actually play. This band is like sooooooo deep. Like Chester Bennington, I am a tortured artist; one too complex and intelligent to be understood by people who don't watch MTV or TRL. That's why I like MTV, because it caters to head-strong anti-mainstream rebels such as myself. So, if you are sick of fake "metal" from posers with long hair who don't know how to hold their instruments, then get this. If you want something just as deep that still rocks then get Good Charlotte.
