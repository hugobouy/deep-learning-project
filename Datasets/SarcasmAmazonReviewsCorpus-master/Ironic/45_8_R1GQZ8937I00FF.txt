<PRODUCT>Fleeced: How Barack Obama, Media Mockery of Terrorist Threats, Liberals Who Want to Kill Talk Radio, the Self-Serving Congress, Companies That Help Iran, and Washington Lobbyists for Forei (Paperback)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
Just one example:
 
 "Killing talk radio" is actually reviving the Fairness Doctrine where the media were required to allow alternate points of view.   Ronald Reagan killed this doctrine, allowing guys like Rush Limbaugh to spew their distortions and right wing propaganda nonstop for three hours every day of the week, with no one to challenge them.  Is allowing alternate points of view a bad thing?
 
 Funny how the media is supposedly controlled by the liberals, but it is the conservatives who are so afraid of having alternate points of view.  Don't waste your time on this trash.
