<REVIEW>
When Big Bobby Ray told me there was a foxy lady's version of that legendary 3 Wolves shirt I just had to get one for myself. Look out Bobby Raye there's a new Loca Lobo in town. My hands trembled when I opened the package and I couldn't get over that lovely Trailer Lavendar color and the almost air-brushed quality of the wolves. I cranked up the Kid Rock, put on my best cut-offs (you know the kind, that ride up just enough in the front and back) gave the bleach blond hair a fresh squirt of Aquanet (roots be darned) and told that Bobby Ray we were loading up in the Trans Am and to let that coon tail fly. These lady wolves really unleash my womanly power, no woman at Wal-mart, the tanning salon, the county fair, the beer joint, or the Nascar race will look hotter. Ok, Verna Sue, we'll see who gets promoted at the feed store now! Especially when I tie the shirt just so and let a little of the jelly hang out- must be jelly cause jam don't shake like that. Just look at those wolves...no one can resist the "come here big boy" look of that she-wolf. Can't wait for this Friday night when Bobby and I wear our matching wolf redneck couture line and go down to the Bingo hall and then when we get home...if the trailer's rockin' don't bother knockin. All thanks to this graceful wolf finery- get yours cause I got mine.
