<REVIEW>
I bought this air compressor to use for airbrushing.  I need 20-40 psi and less than 1 cfm.  This compressor will generate 100 psi.  Here is the funny part...  the instruction sheet says for break-in you should turn the regulator valve clockwise all the way and leave it open (no hose, etc) and run for 5 minutes before using.  Fair enough.  No regulator... no valve... the think runs 100 psi and just splills that out into what ever you hook up to it.  You would have to add a regulator to it.  The other joke... it was so incredibly loud it was louder than my 6 HP 60 gallon upright compressor in my garage!!!  Ran it in my basement with the doors and windows shut and my wife was concerned the neigbors Easter dinner would be unejoyable in their homes in the neibhorhood around the house.  The noise was incredible...  I would say equivalent to a Jet air craft taking off in close proximity in terms of decibles.  I have been exposed to two of Campbell Hausfeld's compressors... both were the worst pieces of engineering garbage I have ever seen.   No reflection on Amazon please.
