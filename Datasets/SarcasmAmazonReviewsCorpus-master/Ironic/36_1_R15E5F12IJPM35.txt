<REVIEW>
It is almost blasphemic to use mortal words to describe this garment. A product that carries within it the power of not one, but three times the wolf intensity. I purchased this shirt (legally must be called so, although it more closely resembles armor) after months of debating how to survive taking tank rounds to the chest. Once equipped with this modern day chain-mail, I slammed a Rockstar and was well on my way to becoming more creature than man. I bolted out the door leaving a trail of fire and wolf fibers behind me as I was ready to take on any challenge the world through my way.
 
 Cars and builings disentegrated when the shirt waved in the wind as I ran by, winds that even Tom Schilling could not predict. That is when I met my destruction. I approached a trailer park where a small lad about 7 years young stood with a shirt portraying 4 wolves. HOW COULD THIS BE??? I Remember yelling... HOW????? No punch or kick was needed to defeat me. I had been out-wolved. I returned to my nest to regather myself and await in teh darkness for a 5 wolf shirt that will bring about the end of man.
 
 Til then.. $17 dollars of magnificance. Use at own risk.
