<PRODUCT>Kodak EasyShare M580 14MP Digital Camera with 8x Wide Angle Optical Zoom and 3.0 Inch LCD (Blue) (Electronics)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
All I wanted was a camera that could "burn" the date into the picture, like all the ones I've had for the past 10 years.  I take a lot of rapid-fire pictures.  Some genius at Kodak decided the decision should only be made on a picture-by-picture basis, and to keep the feature on is not a good idea.  Hence, it got returned.
