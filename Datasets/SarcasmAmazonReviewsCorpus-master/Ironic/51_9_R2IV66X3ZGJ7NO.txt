<REVIEW>
That review above mine is just some crap written by some poser with no taste. 50 Cent is just as good as all those old "musicians" that you cherish. People give him crap because he can't read or write muzak. Even more people give him crap because he can't read or write. I've heard posers come out with garbage like "he merely exploits his image and shallow agenda because he wants money" and "his songs are retarded enough to allow him daily access to a wheelchair" etc etc etc. But I have one question for you. How many times have your precious "musicians" been shot? Everybody needs to remember that muzak quality (espeically in the case of rappers who the greatest musicians of them all) is based on the toughness. How many times has Beethoven been shot? Or Miles Davis? Or that poser with the violin? Exactly. Speaking of Beethoven, I don't know why people give him credit just because he made a bit of music when he was deaf. If you want a great musician with disabilities then go for 50 Cent.
