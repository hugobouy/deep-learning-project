<REVIEW>
I wish someone at Amazon would have kissed me first just to get me a little excited first! this guitar is untunable all six strings buzz out from the nut to the 12th fret it was supposed to include a digital tuner I didn't get one the amp does nothing but buzz (Oh wait that's the distortion, huh? THAT'S THE DISTORTION?) stay as far away from this one as possible I'd return it but I can't afford to ship it back I don't have the cash so I'm stuck with it! I repeat do not buy this guitar pack from anyone!
