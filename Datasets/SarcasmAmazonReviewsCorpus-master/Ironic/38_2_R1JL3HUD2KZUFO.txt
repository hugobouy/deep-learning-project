<PRODUCT>The Alchemist: A Fable About Following Your Dream (Paperback)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
I read this book to find out what all the fuss was about. What followed was sour disappointment.  Storyline: No more sophisticated than those shortened bible stories for five-year olds.  Style: I have read microwave oven instructions with more literary flair.  Characterization: Flat, lifeless "characters", distinguishable only through phrases like "the boy", "the girl", or "the Englishman".  Tone: Preachy and patronizing to the point of being irritating.  Message: "Follow your dreams". How deep, and original. Further Peeve: Coelho encourages men to follow their dreams, while a woman's destiny is to await her man ("She never asked you to stay because a woman of the desert knows that she must await her man" - p. 126). This is not taken out of context. Throughout the book, the whole "follow your dreams" motto is limited to male protagonists.   Don't be duped by the 'warm fuzzy feeling' Coelho tries to leave you with. This book is as deep as a puddle.(...)
