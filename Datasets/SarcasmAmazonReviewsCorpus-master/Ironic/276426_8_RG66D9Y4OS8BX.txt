<REVIEW>
The spunky gal who first appeared on the scene as a simple-minded but endearing propaganda puppet for global corporate policy has now graduated to become the poster girl for those suffering from terminal stupidity.  The description of the book states that the book was ghostwritten (for SP fans - "ghostwritten" means she didn't write it herself - someone else wrote it for her).  In view of this fact, it's interesting to see that customer reviews praise the book by saying "oh now that I've read the book, I know the real Sarah!"  Like George W. Bush, Sarah Palin is incapable of writing a book, and it's quite possible that, like George W. Bush, she has difficulty reading books. 
 The conservative media (especially Fox News) has created a virtual Disneyland for those who can't handle reality to immerse themselves in.  And Sarah Palin is the princess in that Right Wing castle, who rose from humbleness to prominence by memorizing speeches written by her handlers from the RNC.  Why anyone would actually pay money to read this poorly written fiction is beyond belief.  If you really want to read a book by a prominent fascist, read Mein Kampf, it's well written and explains the mythos of the white master race much better than Sarah does.
