<REVIEW>
This is a fitness system. Who needs fitness systems the most? Heavy people. 
 
 Guess what? I got on the balance board to be weighed and it told me I was too heavy to use it. Mind you I am not a "Biggest Loser" Candidate. I am just over the 250 lb limit. 
 
 Why would you build this without making it capable of working for bigger people? These are the people who want to lose weight in the privacy of their homes, until they are gym ready. 
 
 Completely stupid, upsetting, annoying and unfair. Wasted money.
