<REVIEW>
If you are a rich woman sitting at home with nothing else to do but analyze your pregnancy bit by bit and rant about it all.....then you should read this! Because that's this book is all about! It can be actually scary for first time pregnant women who read this. God knows how it came to the Best Seller list.
