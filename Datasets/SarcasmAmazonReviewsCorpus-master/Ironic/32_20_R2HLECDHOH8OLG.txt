<REVIEW>
Paul Blart is a mall cop and although he's clumsy at times, he's definitely not a loser. He's an inspiration for security "officers" everywhere. As the drama unfolds, we see that Blart doesn't get the respect he deserves from anyone in the movie. Several times I had to wipe the tears from my eyes as I watched the film.  Kevin James is a highly underrated actor in the mold of William Shatner as well as being an hilarious comedian. His role in "Mall Cop" is similar to Jackie Gleason's in "Smokey and the Bandit". If you don't like this movie, you probably hate weight challenged people, and if you hate them, you most likely hate America.
