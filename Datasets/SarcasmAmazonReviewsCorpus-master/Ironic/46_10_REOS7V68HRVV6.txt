<PRODUCT>Snuggie Fleece Blanket As Seen On TV</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
Immediately upon seeing the infomercial about the Snuggie, I was ecstatic!  I have been too stupid to use a normal blanket my whole life.  I often find myself violently exasperated when I am forced to answer the phone and my blanket falls off one shoulder, leaving me achingly cold.  I mean, why are blankets so slippery????  People have only been using blankets in one form or another since the dawn of man.....and they are just so damn inconvenient!  I have often expressed frustration with a society that forces us to conform to such barbaric notions at the "blanket."  
 Well, never again, my friend.  Never again.
 
 Seriously.  This is the dumbest thing I have ever seen.  If I get one for christmas, I'm turning it into a dog bed.
