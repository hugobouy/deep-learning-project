<REVIEW>
I have found to my great horror that this Relaxation Capsule opens portals into other worlds, worlds that man was never meant to open.  I have opened a portal to the realm of the Great Old Ones and unleashed them upon this world.  I do not know how much longer I shall be able to maintain my sanity, that is if I should be fortunate enough to survive so long.  If I am not able to somehow reverse this, using my Uranium Ore  and banish The Old Ones back to their nether realm, it shall be the doom of all humanity!  If I should fail, please forgive me.
 
 Purchasers of this relaxation capsule should beware of opening other-worldly portals, as many powerful and dangerous forces lurk in hidden recesses of this universe, waiting to unleash terror upon this world.
