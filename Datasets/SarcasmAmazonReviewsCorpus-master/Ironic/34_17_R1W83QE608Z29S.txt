<REVIEW>
First, the audio narrator was UNBEARABLE...She had a small s-lisp that kept jerking me out of the story--which was bad enough without the constant interruption. She gave the main character a sickly sing-song voice and put a STRONG inflection on the last word of each of her sentences. It was maddening! On top of that she talked obnoxious baby-talk to the dogs--Ugh! The hero's charactor was so flat and unemotional while every other character came through like a small child trying to do voices...cringe-worthy.
  
 Secondly, THE STORY STUNK! It was a boring manual on dog training with a few moments of babbling dialogue about NOTHING. The heroine/hero were bland and rude respectively and together they were totally forgettable. The serial killer was stuck in here and there like an afterthought. The ending was just as unimpressive. I'd rather listen to nails scraped down a chalkboard than have to endure this book again.
