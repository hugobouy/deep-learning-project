<REVIEW>
I ordered this as I work in a rough neighborhood.  My boss was stabbed recently outside the office; and another colleague was shot last year.  As I have to walk a bit from the bus; I needed some added protection.  I purchases this item; and it looks fantastic.  I get some odd stares on the bus- but it is pretty intimidating.  The other day; I was mugged and feeling brash in my armor, I told the guy off.  Well- needless to say he went after me.  The knife didn't get through the armor at all.  The blade broke- and rather than being stabbed-- I was pushed over and kicked several times before the mugger ran off.
 
 The only downside is that it is heavy; and it took me about 5 minutes of rolling around on the ground before I could stand up.
