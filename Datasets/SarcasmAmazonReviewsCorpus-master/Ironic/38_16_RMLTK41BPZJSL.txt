<REVIEW>
I bought these for all of [...] bucks, and my expectations were REALLY low - but I'm going abroad and all I needed was marginally better sound than what comes out of the microscopic ports on my MacBook. But these plastic "speakers" were actually worse - I couldn't yank them out of the audio jack fast enough. The bass sounds like two hamsters coughing in a milk carton. I'm shocked Hewlett-Packard would put their logo on this junk - how much can they even make on these? Somewhere at HP there's a product manager with a bright future ahead of him... as a busboy in the Adirondacks.
