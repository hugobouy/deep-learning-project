<REVIEW>
'Cause ya know: dose tings fall to da ground right often. Sumtimes widdout no warnin at all. An yours is such a pristine an bootiful egsample of da iPhone dat maybe youse should tink about...protectin it. Now i'm not sayin dat sometin is GONNA happen to it: jus' dat sumtin MIGHT happen...axe-i-dental like, see? Fallin out da pocket...slippin from da hand...tossin it to yer buddah-finga'd buddy. Stuff happens. Oh, geez: I'm sorry about yer glass, dere, buddy! I'm so clumsy dese days!
 
 Now DIS ting, dis OtterBox: it's da BOMB, man! See, youse puts it in da cradle BACKwards, so's da face don't get all scratched by da pointy corners and junk in da offices. After a few brews, ya know,them straight lines like to play around. And wid dis rubberized outer layer wid a hard plastic shell? I'm tellin ya- an youse can believe me- dat dis ting will protect yer bootiful iPhone from a nice fall. Maybe even a kick or two. i'm jes  sayin. No need to git upset! I'm just tellin youse what wut COULD happen. Hey: I've had it happen to mine more dan a few times, I can tell ya! An dis OtterBox case: dis ting just took it wid a big smile. Course, now I can't sleep at night wit dis ting near da bed. I'm a bit worried 'bout it...gettin back at me, like. Udderwise, I can't say enuff good tings 'bout it, know wut i'm sayin? 
 
 So get one fer youses iPhone. Ya jest never know...and oh...I'm sorry again ! i didn't see dat nise vase youse had sittin on the pedestal in fronta me! I really AM so clumsy dese days!
