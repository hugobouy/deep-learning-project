<REVIEW>
I don't know where all of these people are getting their ratings from. Did we read the same book? The only possible reason this book could be a "best seller" is because of how notorious the case is. I have been following this case very closely, and am a huge true crime reader. I am also just an avid reader. This book was simply all of the information I had already read on the internet mashed together. Nothing new, no surprises no insight. I found it tedious to read page after page of law enforcement interviews verbatim--easily accessible from docstoc.com. There was little if any author input or insight and any insight or input given was delivered strangely and in a strange word order that had me re-reading sentences to make sure I understood. In addition to this the author's sentences were very clipped and short. There was no flow, no eloquence, no suspense. It is truly one of the worst books I've read, and it is a shame because I so looked forward to it--in fact, I followed the case so closely, I COULD HAVE WRITTEN IT BETTER! I'm sorry, but I feel like I wasted $7.00. In all fairness, perhaps my distaste for the book was in part due to my knowledge of the case. Maybe those who have no knowledge might enjoy the book. I wouldn't recommend it, but if you want the "cliff notes" to the case, this is the book for you.
