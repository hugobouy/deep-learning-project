<REVIEW>
First off the title of this review may be a little misleading. The handsom Cat Collage t-shirt isn't really greater than Success or happiness, because it actually provides both those things. I found this t-shirt in the alley behind the Kmart near my car (Now most people will say "your car can be anywhere, it moves dummy" not this car, shes just for sleeping, and pretending to wait for someone in). Why anyone would throw this shirt will always be a mystery. 
 
 I haven't taken this shirt off since I found it. There are a few reasons for that. The first is that when I wear it I feel respected. When I walk down the street now large crowds of people seem to part, and they look at me with a kind of controlled fear. I believe this is because of the evil eye the tiger on the right gives anyone with fear or doubt in their hearts. The tiger on left gives stink-eyes to anyone who asks me if i'm leaving my parking spot.
 
 The second reason i have yet to remove this shirt is because i have now set the fashion bar too high. I can't downgrade. Where am I going to find something as striking and visually pleasing to wear on my laundry day? The answer is nothing. Short of tatooing this image on my chest there is nothing earthly or celestial origin that can hold a candle to this beautiful fleece of black and blue. It is an understatement to say that this shirt is screen printed with a mixture of assertiveness and courage with a hint of playful instability. Its simply an eyegasm.
 
 The third reason i haven't taken this shirt off is because it was wet when i first put it on, and due to a sort of full-body trenchfoot i can no longer remove this shirt without a surgical procedure or i risk infection or possibly death.
 
 Saying that it is pleasing to the eye is simply an understatement. Look at it. It has 8 of the most beautifully drawn cats in the world on it. It has the type of cluttered variety that most t-shirt artist won't even attempt. Why wouldn't you want lions AND tigers on your shirt at the same time? Are you racist or something? I hope not. I think if 8 consenting cats want to get together on a t-shirt then by golly this is America and they should be allowed to. So big up to the BCC (Big Cat Collage T-shirt). If you want to do the most satisfying, enjoyable thing you have ever done in your life you will purchase this shirt. If you want to keep you job or make friends then go shop at the Gap or something.
