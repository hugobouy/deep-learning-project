If you notice, a 10 pack is ONLY 10k. The 15 pack is 25k. Why wouldn't anyone just purchase two 10 packs and save the extra 5k for a down payment on a JL421 Badonkadonk Land Cruiser, a 3 wolf moon shirt, a pair of Zubaz, some truck nutz, and a frosty jug of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 gallon, 128 oz.
 
 That's using the ol' noodle
