<REVIEW>
I wish I knew before purchase that this RPG would be almost the EXACT same thing as every other one.  The only difference is, this one comes with the expansions.  Matter of fact, Fallout 3 is a better title than this crap-fest.  The only good thing to have ever come from this was when I brought it to the local game store and traded it for Fallout 3.
 
 The game starts when you're trapped in some castle.  YAWN, like that scenario has never been played out.  The game continues on to repeatedly slap the buyer in the face each time you kill a rat or some other enemy.  I don't get how this has made so many Top 10 lists, this game flat out blows.
