<REVIEW>
As a rabid, frothing cat lover, I picked up the CatGenie Self-Flushing Cat Box for a feral cat I found on the street.  He never did use the cat Flushing Cat Box for reasons I suspect have to do with a fear of metal parts.  I did everything I could for him to use the Flushing Cat Box but he refused.  It was later that I found out that he was blind in both eyes.
 
 The box itself is a superb, fake ceramic bowl type Self-Flushing Cat Box.  It seems to have a little camera which detects Cat movements and has soothing sounds of ocean breezes or other music you choose.  A little robot hand comes out to scoop the Cat waste and then shoves it towards the back where it accumulates for months in a smelly decomposition chamber that will make you vomit when you change it.
 
 I really liked the manual Flushing handle for a cat's paw, not too big, not too small.
 
 In all, you're still going to be doing tons of labor in regards to the Cat waste so you might want to consider the advantage of spending tobacco money on a small toilet that you stuff in the corner of your home that smells like a Formaldehyde fish bowl.
 
 Eventually I gave it to a midget friend because I had sold all my cats to the lab.
