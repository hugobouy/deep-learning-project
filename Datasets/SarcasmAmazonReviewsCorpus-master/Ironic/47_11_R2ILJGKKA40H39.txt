<REVIEW>
Let's start off by saying that I am a big supporter of Apple and their products as well as a proud owner of an iMac, Macbook, iPods, and now the latest and greatest iPhone 4. And being the Apple fan (geek) that I am, I followed the live blog updates from WWDC 2010 a couple of weeks back to get the latest news on the unveiling of the phone. Announcements were being made for awesome new features like Facetime, Retina Display, etc. etc. and... drumroll please... a $29 piece of plastic combined with rubber that only went around the edge of the phone? Really? I mean, I understand that the back is left open for aesthetic purposes (baby got back) but I'm pretty sure that when I drop my phone (and I will drop my phone), my phone is most likely going to land on the back or the front and not on its side. So... I did a little bit of searching and this product was one the of few that took advantage of the iPhone leak (thanks to the guy who "left it at the bar"). And it really did take advantage. Very good fit, durable material, cut outs that make sense. And it didn't cost me 29 bucks. What more can I say? It's a case that fits and does what it supposed to do which is to protect the phone. And apparently also prevent signal loss to people who hold it in their left hand (I guess you can't post links in a review but if you check out engadget, there are a number of articles that will convince you that a case WITH a closed back is very much needed to protect your investment). Apple should've included the bumper in the packaging but hey, that's how businesses make money. So until they make a bumper where it can shoot laser beams or bring about world peace for a whopping 29 bucks, I think I will be sticking with this case.
