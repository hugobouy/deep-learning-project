<REVIEW>
Why I ever bought this mop is still a mystery to me.  First, I bought a Shark vacuum cleaner and it lasted less than a year and received no cooperation from the company. After that, I bought a Shark steam iron and it lasted about 4 months and I was told to send it back for repair and then they would return it. Of course, I had to pay postage both ways and the cost of the repair or replacement. So, I tried one more time with this mop (I know, I need therapy.) and 4 uses later it stopped. After I sign off, I will look up a number for 'Shark Anonymous' in my phone book.
