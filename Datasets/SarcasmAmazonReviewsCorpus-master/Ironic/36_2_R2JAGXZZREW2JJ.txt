<REVIEW>
I must tell you, I've read all the reviews and I doubted the healing qualities and powers of attraction the wolves tees actually command. That was until I ordered the Night Breed version.
 
 I arrived on a Thursday and to my surprise, the box was glowing! Slowly, I picked it up and a large electric surge shot right through my body. I must have been out for a few hours because Springer was on when I came to. 
 
 Half dazed, I got up to get my last PBR and realized I was naked and covered with a thin layer of fur - the shirt burned into my skin and covering my upper torso. I was ashamed, I was dog-like - but I needed more PBR so I threw on a pair of jeans and headed to the Piggly Wiggly. 
 
 Once there, thoughts of fresh meat and procreation ran constantly through my mind - IT JUST WOULDN'T STOP! 45 minutes later I was on my way downtown in the back of a police cruiser. Even though I don't remember a thing, I had evidently ransacked the frozen meat section, assaulted a bag boy's leg and sprayed on a diaper display in aisle nine. 
 
 I don't regret buying the night breed shirt, because quite honestly, I've never felt SOOOOOOO alive! But if you're considering a purchase, just understand the raw power at your fingertips. Understood by few, wielded by even fewer - that's the power of Night Breed.
 
 By the way, I'll be on a upcoming broadcast of COPS - check me out. I'm the only guy on there who actually has a t-shirt on. The Night Breed Tee, that is. 
 
 Gurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
