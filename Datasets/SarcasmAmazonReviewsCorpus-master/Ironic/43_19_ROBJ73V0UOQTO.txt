<REVIEW>
I was chuckling to myself, reading all the great reviews of this product, thinking, "do I have the same monitor?  Am I doing something wrong?".  Then I got to the reviews at the bottom of the page in which other customers were having the same beeping problem as me.  Thank goodness!  We have the baby in a room on the same floor as us -- the monitor is maybe 15 feet away...and it beeps randomly all the time.  God forbid I move it maybe 20 feet away from the base - forget it!  I am out of range (and the monitor doesn't let me forget it - which is good - but I don't feel like I should be out of range at this distance).  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this monitor to anyone, unless you enjoy not sleeping - not due to a baby crying, but rather your monitor beeping!
