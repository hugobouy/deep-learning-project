<REVIEW>
This report is sadly deficient in important marketing data that makes the price of almost 500 quatloos seem a tad pricey. 
 
 I was browsing Amazon.com one day at work instead of taking care of my overdue TPS reports, and I came across this important-looking document. Naturally, I ordered it with one-click and my secret phrase (chicks with goatees) and when it came (overnight with Amazon Prime) I plunged right in.
 
 I was deeply disappointed. There is nothing, NOTHING in here about the important statistic of splinters-per-square-centimeter-of-buttock. No pictures of Chinese buttocks, either, splinter-infested or not. No information on whether or not you can get the stains off the underside of the glazed wood (always an issue at our house) and the frequency of seat failures, in particular the split kind where the wood splits and LOOKS intact and you sit there but when you stand up, the blasted thing is pinching your buttocks and there you are, yelling for a bandaid, looking like a goob with a toilet seat stuck to your bum. Most unfortunate, and I expected this typical seat-fail-incident to be reported and given some statistical data. But, no.
 
 In addition, the report makes no mention if the toilet seat fits on your steering wheel and if so, how many Chinese find it convenient to drive with a toilet seat as a desk and Porta-Potty combo in their automobiles. Another regrettable oversight. 
 
 I was considering buying this firm's report "All the Tea in China"   but I am worried it will be equally incomplete. Anyone know if it's any good?
