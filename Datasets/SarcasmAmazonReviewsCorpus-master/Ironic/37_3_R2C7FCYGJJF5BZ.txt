Alpha male.  Lone wolf.  Leadership. 
   
 These are just a handful of the words I would choose to describe the Wolf Gaze t-shirt (available in various sizes).  Furthermore, I concur 100% with the reviews of the two previous pack leaders regarding the potency of this garment when it comes to the ladies.  My story is as follows... 
 
 Recently, I was invited to an 80's theme party at a campus sorority house.  Knowing that every frat boy d-bag with a faux hawk, tribal tattoo, and crotch rocket would come to the party dressed as Zach Morris (big cell phone, double popped collars, white-washed denim, etc.) I desired a chance to really set myself apart...from the pack.  Naturally, my selection to accomplish this goal had to 1) be wolf-related, 2) project a certain subtle sexuality in its theme, and 3) be a bold color.  Boom!  Wolf Gaze.  Size large.  Piss yellow. 
  
 Admittedly, I did cave slightly to the 80's theme and rocked a pair nylon track pants and Reebok Pumps (hey, even the `lonest' of wolves has to roll with the rules of the forest).  That said, my look was achieved and a vibe was emitted.  Beautiful babies dressed in poofy prom dresses were admiring my status as the alpha male all night long.  
 
 One girl in particular caught my eye from a distance and the hunt was on.  Her hair was frizzy, her earrings were huge, and her outfit was all shades of neon...just my type.  As I went in for the kill, it was as if the power of the Wolf Gaze took over and not only impacted her inner urges, but dictated the song selection as well.  The lights dimmed, the strobes kicked on, and the sweet, sweet sounds of Duran Duran's "Hungry like the Wolf" filled the room.  Needless to say, the night ended successfully.
 
 In conclusion: buy the Wolf Gaze, be the lone-wolf leader that you are, get chicks.  If needed, Duran Duran is always available for support.
