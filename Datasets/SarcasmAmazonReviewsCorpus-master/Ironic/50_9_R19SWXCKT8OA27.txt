<REVIEW>
This is pure hardcore punk people. This is the type of stuff that your parents can't listen to because it's too xtreme for them to handle. Not only is this hardcore anti-mainstream punk rock, it also has some of the greatest instrument work evar. I think only Kurt Cobain and Avril Lavigne can play guitar better than these guys. People bring names of unknown posers like John Petrucci, Jason Becker, Michael Romeo and Al di Meola, but fact is they suck because I've never heard of them (because they don't play their songs on TRL. That means they are a load of ass). The bass player is equally amazing, showing losers like Victor Wooten, Tony Levin, John Myung etc how to actually play the bass. And the drumming!! this guy is brilliant, and I don't mean like the so-called "brilliant drumming" of poser losers  like Donati or Portnoy or Cobham or any of those losers. I mean REAL talent. And where do you find talent? MTV and TRL of course!! this rocks almost as much as Ashlee Simpson
