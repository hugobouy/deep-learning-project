<REVIEW>
This is atrocious.  I'm watching "Life" on Discovery channel right now, with Oprah narrating.  Some of the reviewers said that the script was re-written for her, and I can believe it.  I can't believe Attenborough saying lines like "hunting crab seals is toooo much work!"  Oprah narrates this thing as if she were reading a bedtime story to little kids and comes off as snarky and condescending.  In the opening segment, she's discussing a fox chasing an ibex kid and it's basically like "heeeere comes the fox!  UH OH!!"
 
 The most embarrassing thing is that I'm thinking that British people think that Americans demanded this.  Who's going to be doing the next special, Dr. Phil?  "Oh-kaaay, here comes the alee-gaytor, it's prey tries to run, but that neeeever works!  HAW HAW HAW!"  Don't get this.  Get the real version.
