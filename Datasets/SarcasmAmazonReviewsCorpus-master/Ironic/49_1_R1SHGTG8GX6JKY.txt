<REVIEW>
For my entire life I have had one major problem...  I cannot for the life of me answer the phone while on the sofa with a blanket.  How many times do I have to fall off the sofa trying before I just let the answering machine pick up.  Now with the Snuggie I can answer the phone while on the sofa watching TV at 1AM!  THANK YOU SNUGGIE FOR SAVING MY LIFE!!  
 
 Ok, in reality this thing is a piece of junk.  Much thinner than they make it sound, no closure for the back, and you look like a member of Heaven's Gate.  All they need to send with it is a bottle of Red Kool-Aid and you are set for your 100% authentic Cult experience!
 
 This makes a good gag gift, but be sure to get it ANYWHERE but their website unless you want to get ripped off on shipping and want to wait 10 weeks to get it.  10 weeks is too long for me to miss my 1AM phone calls.
