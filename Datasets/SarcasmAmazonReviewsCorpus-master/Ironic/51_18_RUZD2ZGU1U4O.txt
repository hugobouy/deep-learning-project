<REVIEW>
It's been a year so I'm fuzzy on some details of the &quot;plot&quot; but I vividly remember how awful this was, even embarrassing to watch. I know very little about physics but I knew the &quot;science&quot; was bogus.  More problems: 1. Drunk Russian stereotype - yeah, he's smart enough to be  an astronaut but even their scientists are vodka-swilling boozehounds. 2.  Willis chases Affleck with shotgun after finding B.A. in bed with L.Tyler;  so unfunny and another movie cliche 3. Fire on asteroid? No oxygen for it  to burn. 4. No bomb can blow up asteroid that big 5. They become astronauts  after a few weeks training. 6. Bruce Willis' presence. 7. Yet more  stereotypes: Fat guy, big black guy, goofy yet smart little guy, etc. You  know the routine.  8. NASA people incompetent; stand around and let an oil  driller run show. 9. Love scene between LT and BA 10.Aerosmith soundtrack.  Don't always dislike them, but these songs were crappy. 11....ad infinitum:  The bad science I mentioned earlier. I wish a real asteroid had hit the set  when they were shooting this.  Absolutely horrific. Appalling. I was so  embarrassed to be watching this movie.  Please, spare yourself the torture.
