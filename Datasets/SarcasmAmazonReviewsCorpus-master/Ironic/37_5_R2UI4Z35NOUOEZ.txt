<REVIEW>
Seriously?? People, Suzanne Collins is stealing ideas from different books and movies and piecing them together, creating "something completely new." Come on. When I read this book, the only thing I could think was, "Hmm, where have I seen THIS before? OH YEAH, "Battle Royale" by Koushun Takami, "The Long Walk" by Steven King, "Lord of the Flies" by William Golding, the movie The Condemned, et cetera." This is plagiarism at its worst, I mean this book has been written a thousand times, and she didn't even try to change any circumstances.
 
 ...And now she is being recognized as inspirational, bringing a "completely new concept" of kids killing kids?? IT'S BEEN DONE! It disgusts me that no one has sued her for this second-rate version of amazing literature. Also, if she's going to completely steal their story lines, she could at least do it well; Her writing is terrible.
 
 Not only that, but she's using a textbook example of a dystopian society. Like, there's not a thing that makes this society new or different. It's all so cliche! Can't she think of a single new concept? I mean, putting things in the blender isn't a skill.
 
 Well, that pretty much ends my rant. Please, if you're going to buy something, buy an original! Try Battle Royale, that's a personal favorite of mine, but whatever you do, don't buy this unoriginal cra p.
 
 Congratulations, Suzanne! You've just proven that idiots without brains in their heads can be successful too!
