<REVIEW>
Do you feel your child is about to go into the world without all the "necessary" skills? Do you feel your loved one isn't adequately prepared to face life's most daunting challenges? Have you ever wondered what to do if you're stuck on a raising drawbridge? Are you so paranoid that you look for an escape to every situation? If you answered yes to any and/or all of these questions, then buy this book, NOW! This is your bible to every worst-case situation that life may throw at you, and more.
 
 But don't think this is strictly a humor book, and sure it may contain some of that, like how to escape from a costumed character/mascot, or you should escape a meeting by crawling under the table, but there's plenty of serious entries to go along. For example, if your elevator is plummeting, something I fear all the time, then you should lie flat on your stomach to distribute the force. They do go to experts for many of these entries, and although I wouldn't like to test any of them, I'm sure they're pretty useful in the situation.
 
 It's the best-of the long-time series, sure to help with most any predicament you may find yourself in. And for further reference, this edition contains a CD with ever scenario, in full, complete with a few wallpapers and screensavers for good measure. Just be warned, every scenario is in Adobe Acrobat format, which I hate since it's such a difficult program to navigate.
 
 Overall, you can't go wrong in giving this as a gift to somebody, whether you're giving it to them for practical or enjoyment purposes. I highly recommend it for any rainy day, paranoid people, or anybody who just ever wondered what to do if... well, you get the point.
