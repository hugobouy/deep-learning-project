<REVIEW>
One was having a particularly difficult time getting out of bed early this morning.  One was having anguished thoughs about one's job at the massage parlor, particularly the difficulty in keeping one's kimono clean.  One called in sick and went back to bed, when, &quot;ding dong&quot;  the doorbell rang, and the magnum opus of Mr Robert Louis Stevenson's imagination arrived courtesy of Fed Ex!  One finally got out of bed, signed for the package, watched the five-o-clock news, and &lt;tingling&gt; with anticipation, put the DVD into the player. One was not disappointed. One imagines that Mr Hasshoffler was exactly what Mr RL Stevenson originally envisioned when the worthy scribe first started mixing lanadaum with opium and &lt;dreamed&gt; up this this towering paragon of munificent masuclinity and bountiful hair that is Mr Hyde.  One belives that it has taken all this time to find the &lt;perfect&gt; actor to play this towering pillar of manhood.  Who else could carry all that rage and potential virility through an entire 2 hour musical?  Who else but out very own Mr Hassassoffler?  One imagines that &quot;Knight Rider&quot; and &quot;Baywatch&quot; existed for the sole purpose of training and preparing our own Mr Hassloft for the role of both his and Our's lifetimes.   One feels quite refreshed.  One is prepared to go to work now. One also recommends the &quot;Looking For&quot; album by Mr Hasselhop.  The 6th track, &quot;Hot Shot City&quot; is particularly good.
