<REVIEW>
This book made me want to beat my head over a wall.
 
 Paul D seems to be the only sane character. Everyone else seems to have some mental issues. I couldn't relate to anyone or anything in this book. The plot was disturbing and creepy, and the writing was very hard to follow. I found myself staring at the pages to make my mom think I was reading it (I had to read this for a summer English assignment), but not actually comprehending the words. 
 
 The only good part of this book is that it put me to sleep easily, so I got much more sleep than usual.
 
 Everyone talks about hidden meanings and symbols in this book, but I was too bored to even understand what I was reading.
 
 I love to read, and I loved reading Shakespeare in class, but Beloved? I'd rather eat dirt & watch the grass grow. It's extremely boring, and everything is just strange and wrong. Don't watch the movie either unless you like violence, insanity, incest, rape, cuss words every few sentences, bodily fluids flying every which way, and just all around crappiness. However, all of those things happen in the book anyways; you just picture them in your mind (which, unfortunately, scars you for life) instead of seeing them on a screen.
 
 While I was reading this, I kept thinking (more like hoping) that the book had to be ending soon, but then I would realize that I was only on page 30. I am honestly considering throwing this book in a fire and happily watching it burn and turn to ashes.
