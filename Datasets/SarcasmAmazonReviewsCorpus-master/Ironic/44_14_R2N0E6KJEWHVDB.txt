<REVIEW>
The Emperor has no clothes!  In the best tradition of Saul Alinsky's "Rules for Radicals" Fifth Rule, Laura Ingraham has effectively ridiculed our Pompous President.  Since most of his actions are too outrageous for simple reporting, Laura has had to resort to satire to properly describe the Obumbler.  It's about time that someone told the real truth about our Marxist-in-residence at the White House.
