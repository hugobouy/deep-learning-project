<REVIEW>
I watched this movie twice, trying each time to do so with an open mind and see what all the hype about this movie was about. And each time I failed. The characters are battery-operated stock characters lousily acted by good (or potentially good) actors. We have the strict and egotistical father, the pragmatic and kind mother who holds the family together, the angst-ridden adolescent played by someone aged 21 (as if any teen who reads Nietzsche wants to go into the air force), the boozing-womanizer-Brooklynite grandfather (a depiction of Norman Mailer?), the depressed, pseudo-intellectual uncle (who does not act or look depressed at all during the film) and the princess daughter who enters into a beauty pageant. What happens between the beginning and the end is scarcely relevant, much less interesting: Van breaks down. Grandpa dies (none too soon). Daughter makes fun of beauty pageant contestants by doing a strip tease to the tune of Rick James' "Superfreak." Une vraie piece de restistance. Ha, more like a piece de merde. Don't waste your money on this waste of talent.
