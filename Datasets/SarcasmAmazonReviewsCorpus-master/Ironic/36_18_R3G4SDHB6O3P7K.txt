<REVIEW>
If this was written by Danielle Steel I hope she was forced to get a story out no  matter how bad !!!  Truthfully I have a hard time believing this was written by the same writer I've been reading for 25 yrs.  I enjoy a good cheap romance story and I've read many Harlequin romance books and this book isn't even as good as some of the worst Harlequin.  This book is so bad I really believe Steel should give all of us  a refund or at the very least send us a coupon to purchase her next book free which is probable the only way you could get me to read it.
