<PRODUCT>Geospace Walkaroo Stilts by Air Kicks - Light Weight (Toy)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
Would have been nice if the stilts could accommodate multiple/varying heights.  Seems to be only two settings...if not just right for your child's height, the stilts are a little awkward to use.  If you have two children of different heights, you have to change the settings...which cannot be done just by 'clicking a button'.
