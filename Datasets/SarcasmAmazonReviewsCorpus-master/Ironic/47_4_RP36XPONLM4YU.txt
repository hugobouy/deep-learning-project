<PRODUCT>Motorola Motofone F3 Unlocked Phone with Dual-Band GSM 850/1900--International Version with No Warranty (Black) (Wireless Phone Accessory)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
This is good phone. It is a phone, not an operating control for the space shuttle.
 
 the phone arrived in the appropriate cannister, but it seemed that it had been tampered with.  at least it appeared to have been glued together.  after one month of use the phone has come apart.  I believe this is a recycled phone and so I would not recommend that you buy from this company.  
 
 finally, the phone is quite flimsy, if you put in in your pocket it will crack, if you drop it, it will break.  love the epaper, disappointed with the fragility of the thing.  imagine you are in the thirld world (the phone is designed to sell in poor asian and african markets), you put together a month worth of savings to buy this phone.  then while carrying out your daily labors the phone cracks, which is very easy to do...can you imagine the heartbreak.  
 
 I will not rebuy this phone model, although I love MOTOROLA.
