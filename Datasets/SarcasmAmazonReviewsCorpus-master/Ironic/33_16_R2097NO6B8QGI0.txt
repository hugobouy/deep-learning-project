<REVIEW>
Apparantly my first review was censored by Amazon, so here goes again.  This movie is, by far, the worst film i've ever tried to watch.  I say 'tried' because after two separate attempts I couldnt bear to watch more than half of the film.  This is coming from someone who gave Eraserhead 5 stars, so take this as a very bad sign.
 
 Long story short, Andre is self-absorbed and does nothing but talk endlessly about insignificant, flaky, artsy stuff.  For example, imagine the most self-important Art major you've ever met talking about how hot-gluing scraps of trash to a canvas represents the struggle a ham sandwich about to be eaten.  Or anything completely nonsensical such as that, that is the level of conversation these men have in this film.  I watched this movie because it was compared to a scene in Linklater's Waking Life (which was intelligent and thought-provoking).  IF you pay the absurd amount of money they are asking for this DVD, there is something wrong with you.
