<REVIEW>
I was given the Three Wolf Moon shirt as a gift for my departure from my current job assignment.  Immediately upon donning the shirt, I was attacked by mobs of women at the pub.  My wife was actually trampled to death by the sudden rush of women.  Fortunately, the 3 wolves soothed my grief  . . . and taught me to fly.  After taking a quick aerial cruise around England, I returned to my compatriots.  It was a difficult landing, due largely in part to the throngs of women in waiting.  After using my laser vision to clear an LZ, I regained my Earthly contact (if you can call constant hovering "contact").  The Ancient Egyptians believed that the difference between a king and a pharaoh was that pharaohs were actually gods on Earth.  After placing the shirt upon my body, I was aware of the state of reverence in which pharaohs were held.  This was due in large part to the fact that all about me (approx. 300 people/worshippers) were laying prostrate before my holy visage.  King Tut has nothing on me thanks to Three Wolf Moon. 
 
 I did notice a minor drawback to Three Wolf Moon.  It involved the inability to make things explode with my mind.  I felt it was a basic application of The Shirt.  Apparently, I bought a knockoff because my friend purchased Three Wolf Moon and was instantly able to blow up the head of the guy who was sleeping with his girlfriend.  I wanted to use it to destroy Fenway Park and allow Wrigley Field to be the sole historical ballpark, but apparently I purchased The Shirt from a different supplier than Pocahontas.
