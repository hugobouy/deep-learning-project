<REVIEW>
Imagine Kitty Kelley as a political reporter, with her unnamed sources and her dubious methods. Now imagine she's a total nutbar, someone hanging onto reality with one last cuticle as she rants, frothing, at the one man she believes responsible for her downfall.  If you believe Bill Clinton is Satan, you're going to say &quot;10! 10 plus!&quot; If you have any capacity for rational thought and skepticism, you'll discard this book like a used tissue. Let my sacrifice of brain cells not go in vain -- pass this one up.
