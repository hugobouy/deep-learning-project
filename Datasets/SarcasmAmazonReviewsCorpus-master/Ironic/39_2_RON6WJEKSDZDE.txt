<REVIEW>
Well this one ain't original. I can't believe that men would pay for something that they have in their cupboard. I mean all you need is a little corn starch thrown up in your britches to freshen up.
 
 Now mind you when I was used to herd billy goats on foot I would put so much starch on my whatnots that I would have a fresh batch of chocolate chip muffins in my drawers at the end of the day.
 
 Now Balla Powder says it has peppermint and eucalyptus in it which is a little scary if you live in Australia. Imagine this, your taking a little Rip Van Winkle under a tree and you wake up to some Kola Bear licking you're landing gear. The good news is that you can give the Kola Bear a thank you kiss because his breath will smell minty fresh.
 
 So maybe this stuff is worth the price if you want a Koala Bear to lick your junk.
