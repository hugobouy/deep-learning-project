<PRODUCT>Child Soviet Russian Gas Mask Civilian / Military NEW (Misc.)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
My 8 year old suffers from life threatening peanut allergies. Until I found this wonderful Soviet Russian made civilian/military gas mask manufactured just for children, my son Herbert spent 95% of his time under a sealed bubble tent at home. This excellent mask has really been a godsend as Herbert is now able to attend school, participate in his favorite sports, go to the movies, enjoy the Cub Scouts, etc. The large filter canister fits easily into the matching haversack which also carries his school books and other supplies. He does complain that the mask is hot and cumbersome but his words are muffled and well, easy to ignore. It is after all in his best interest. He will come to understand when he gets older.
