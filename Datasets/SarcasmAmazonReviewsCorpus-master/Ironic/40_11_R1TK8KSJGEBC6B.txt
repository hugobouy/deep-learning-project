<REVIEW>
Yes, the STORY itself is great. The Tuohys should be commended and I am glad they made the film to bring awareness to that. I do like Sandra in it, but was it an Oscar-worthy performance? No. (as a comparison Julia Roberts' performance as Erin Brockovich was far superior) And to put that little kid front and center like that through the whole thing with his over-acting was a total distraction, unrealistic, and annoying. He was the Jar-Jar Binks of the movie for sure. And riiiiiiiiight...this little kid coached Mike making him the great football player that he is because a first grader knows more about football than any real coach does. Sure. Whatever. And TIM MCGRAW in a lead role? Who came up with that idea? Something tells me he didn't show up at the casting call and beat out everyone else out because he's a better actor than all the real actors out there. He's a country western SINGER with NO acting experience (or ability) as I found out from watching this movie. I also find it HARD to believe that she would just be able to yell at some bigoted redneck in the stands and drug dealers and have NO consequences for that at all. Yeah, I'm gonna drive my 7-Series BMW to the drug-dealer hang out, get out dressed in diamonds and expensive clothes and threaten drug dealers who kill people on a regular basis all by myself, get in all of their faces and tell them I have a gun in my $800 Gucci bag and just shut them all down verbally because I'm just ALL THAT? Uh huh. Right.
