<REVIEW>
My My! How clever and original, my Dad dispenses bathroom wisdom with a lot of foul language, It's just the funniest thing, It's so original and new! If you enjoy hanging out in the restroom at interstate rest areas, bars or gas stations you will love this book!
 
 It is touted as a family and fatherhood book of wisdom and humor, any accidental pearl of wisdom contained therein is nullified by the base and gross view of life and women in particular. If you did not get enough of junior high humor, then buy this book. The fact that it is a bestseller is an indicator that our civil and social culture is rapidly spiraling down the drain.  Would you talk to your children in this way? Would you want your children's teachers taking to them in this way? Even sadder still, the cover says it will be adapted for television.
 
 I was asked to review this book for a library.  I read a few pages and thats all it took. Thank God I was not required to buy it. Read something that will elevate your mind, it ain't this book!
