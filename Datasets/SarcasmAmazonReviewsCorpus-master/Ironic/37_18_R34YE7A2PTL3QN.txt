<REVIEW>
We take turns in book and movie reviews. Here is my say on this so-called movie/dvd. The only way to enjoy this dvd is with the sound turned completely off. That's right, just watch the entire movies in silence. At least your eyes will enjoy what will otherwise torture your ears and mind. Let's see what your ears/mind would miss. (I wish mine had.) Marital breakup over oral sex. Hmmm, oh, father and son dating same female (there are old testament laws against such). Black males and black females can't get along, what's new. And the big mouth no-talent d.l. hughley, yuck. I knew something was wrong when all my bookclub member could say about this movie is "uh, well morris chestnut is fine." I mean that's all she could say. Save your money on this dvd and buy a poster of Morris Chestnut, it's less expensive on time and money and mentality.
