<REVIEW>
Hopefully you were smarter than me and read reviews before you bought this overpriced product. Put it this way. The instructions say "if you use a treatment wait 2 weeks before attempting another treatment" Well, after 2 treatments over 1 month didn't work for me I tried 3 treatment in 10 minutes, and each treatment was 10-20seconds over the recommended application time. Guess what happened? well, it is 2 weeks later, and the wart on my finger has doubled in size.
 
 i have seen positive feedback on this product and i'm curious if they bought it when it was a very very small wart or a d-bag share holder/company man.
