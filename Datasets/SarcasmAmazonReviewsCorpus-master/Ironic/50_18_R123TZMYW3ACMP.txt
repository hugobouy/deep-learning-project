<PRODUCT>Paper Tearing Rulers 12: Deckle Edge (Kitchen)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
As a history teacher at a high school full of unruly teenaged cretins, I am a firm believer of corporal punishment.  My classes are full of idiotic punks that would constantly interrupt my compelling lectures.  They'd shoot spitballs at me while I was expounding upon the Japanese Genpei Wars.  They would make rude comments about my weight while I was clarifying the complexities of the German Revolutions of 1848.  They would even post flyers that said "Mr. Anderson is a fat fairy" all around the campus.  Enough was enough!
 
 Back when I was wielding an ordinary wooden ruler, I would only get laughed at.  I needed something that was capable of inflicting maximum damage.  Now that I'm swinging this beast, my class has been the perfect example of decorum.  Even the star quarterback of the football team quavers when threatened by this ruler's serrated edges.  Look who's laughing now, slackers!
 
 --UPDATE--
 Unfortunately I have been fired for the use of corporal punishment in my classrooms and am now working at a local Arby's.  I suggest only using this ruler for tearing paper...not students.
