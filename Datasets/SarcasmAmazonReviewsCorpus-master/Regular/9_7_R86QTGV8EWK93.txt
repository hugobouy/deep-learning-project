<REVIEW>
Ok, I am an old time monkey Island game fan.  I have played them all, and I think this is the best one yet.  I like the cartoon like cinematic style, voice acting is great, and the puzzles are (mostly) fair.  We all gather round and play as a family.  Great puzzle solving fun for parents and kids together.
 
 The user interface isn't perfect. Dragging Guybrush around with the mouse can be a bit difficult(you can also use the arrow keys on the keyboard), and sometimes the camera angles can be a problem.  Also the lip sync is terrible, which is a little distracting at first. 
 
 You can subscribe to all 5 episodes at once and get a break on the single episode price(I did).  At this writing, only the first 2 episodes are available, with new ones scheduled monthly.
