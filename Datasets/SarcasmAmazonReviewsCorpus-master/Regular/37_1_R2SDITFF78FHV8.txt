<REVIEW>
The movie, "The Bounty Hunter," starring Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston was far more than entertaining. The movie as a whole was very consistent. It was a good mix, it had comedy, action, and serious moments that were very all well planned. I would go see this movie again and recommend it for everyone!
