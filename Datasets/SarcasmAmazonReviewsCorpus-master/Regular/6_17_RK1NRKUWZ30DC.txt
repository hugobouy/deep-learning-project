<REVIEW>
Excellent movie!  Good character development, reasonable premise for the movie, and good acting. The main character's wife is a dedicated doctor who refuses to leave a patient in need and the son saving as many as possible when the worst is about to happen.  The Scottish character's comments about the question, "Can scotch be burned in the generator?" was great, "....are you mad?  That's 12 year old scotch!" and then pulls out a book to find 3 glasses hiding behind it.
 
 As of the writing of this review, there is a class 4 hurricane bearing down on New Orleans, LA and Biloxi, MS.  The idea of massive storms correcting our global warming is feasible.  The inclusion of the frozen mastodon was a nice touch!  Most everyone knows of the stories of instantly frozen mastodons with flowers in their mouths and this movie provided vivid realism of how instant freezing can occur.  My 10 year old son and my mother watched this movie.  The realism and sheer terror of the possibilities went over my son's head.  But my 77 year old mother thought it was the best movie she had seen in years.  
 
 I must say, I agree with my mom for once! The Day After Tomorrow is the best movie I have seen in a long time!
