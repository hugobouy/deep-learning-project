<REVIEW>
I don't play PC games any more, and I watch (most) movies on my nice television. So, what I really wanted from these little speakers was to be able to listen to iTunes every once in a while, and watch assorted videos online (YouTube, Video.Google, and even Netflix every once in a while).
 
 These speakers are perfect for exactly that.
 
 The small size means that they don't take up too much real-estate on my desk (about 3.5 inches wide and 3 inches deep), but they're nice enough that I can enjoy listening to music or videos.
 
 And, with USB, that means not having to worry about a lot of cords.
 
 Overall, I've been very happy with this purchase.
