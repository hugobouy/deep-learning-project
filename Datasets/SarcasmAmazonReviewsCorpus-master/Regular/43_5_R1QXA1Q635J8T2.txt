<PRODUCT>Haier MWM12001SCGSS 1-1/5-Cubic-Foot 1000-Watt Grill and Convection Microwave Oven, Stainless Steel (Kitchen)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
Great product at a great price. It is not a very large microwave but it does a lot and saves me a lot of counter space by not having multiple appliances that one microwave/convection over can do. I have shopped around for similar products before buying this one and similar products go for a lot more. This one looks good, performs well and is affordable.
