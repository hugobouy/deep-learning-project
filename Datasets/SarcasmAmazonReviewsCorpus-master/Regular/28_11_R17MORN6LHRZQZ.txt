<REVIEW>
I bought this phone on the day it came out and I have to say that I am not disappointed at all.  If you like a pull-out/physical keyboard, then this phone is not for you.  But if you like the touchscreen, this is an amazing phone.  I find the new sure-press screen very comfortable to type on, and the phone's capabilities are terrific.  I've already synced my iTunes music to the phone and no longer carry around an iPod.
 The network speed when using the Internet is great, but of course that's because Verizon has a solid network.
