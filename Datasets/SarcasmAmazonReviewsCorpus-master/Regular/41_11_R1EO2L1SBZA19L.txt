<REVIEW>
I just moved in to a new Condo, and this kit is perfect for basic set up and maintenance.  If you want to do a full on renovation you might want to look elsewhere though.  All the tools are good quality and work great.  Not much to say beyond that.  I rated it 4 stars due to the absence of a tape measure (not that they're hard to come by, I thought it was odd that it wasn't included) and the price.  I paid $54.99 and was satisfied, but $99 might be a bit too pricey, but certainly not outrageous.
