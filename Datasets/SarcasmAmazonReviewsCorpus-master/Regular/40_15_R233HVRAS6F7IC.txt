<PRODUCT>Dereliction of Duty: The Eyewitness Account of How President Bill Clinton Compromised America's Long-Term National Security (Hardcover)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
This book is sure to be loudly denounced and vehemently derided, but coming, as it does, from a member of Clinton's own military security detail, it will most likely never be debunked. Lieutenant Colonel Robert &quot;Buzz&quot; Patterson penned &quot;Dereliction of Duty&quot; after his retirement because he would never have been able to publish this kind of information while working for the government. &quot;Dereliction of Duty&quot; is a gripping, yet horrifying read that'll have you realizing how lucky the U.S. was during the eight year Clinton/Gore Administration. One of the most damning charges is that Clinton once lost the &quot;nuclear football,&quot; the suitcase that carries this country's nuclear launch codes. Clinton's response, according to Patterson, was a cavalier, &quot;I'll track'em down guys.&quot; You'll also read about the time in 1998 that Clinton blew off his National Security Advisor so he could finish a round of golf, while stealth-bombers, engines running, their pilots in the cockpits, sat on a Mid-East tarmac  until the cover of darkness was lost and a vital mission against Saddam Hussein was called off. Patterson also gives an entirely new look at the &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; story, with Clinton denying the troops the weaponry they requested, then sending them into harm's way and ultimately blaming the disaster on his Secretary of Defense. &quot;Dereliction of Duty&quot; is a searing indictment of the Clinton administration from an insider's view. This book deserves to be read by every American!
