<REVIEW>
Firefly was a show that came on the heels of Fox's usual brilliant decision-making--right after it cancelled my beloved Dark Angel.  I first thought this show would be awful, but I sat down and watched it--and it was love.  Truly.  It's rare to find a show that can be taken seriously that also made me laugh out loud in every episode.  The writing was extraordinary, and the actors/actresses were absolute gold.  It was really like watching a movie each time around.  Yet again, Fox shot itself in the foot and iced another good show.  Nonetheless, at least the DVD is soon to come.  At least they had the decency to do that.  Come on, sing it with me: "Take my love, take my land, take me where I cannot stand.  But I don't care--I'm still free.  You can't take the skies from me..."
