<REVIEW>
Ordered Monday night, FedEx got it here (Manhattan, NY) on Friday. It was shipped from Kentucky.
 
 Sanyo makes a great fridge that's a good price per cubic foot. The packaging lacked a lot of styrofoam protection and the box was a bit tattered from the shipping, but overall it's a good deal, because of the free shipping for this 50lb. plus item. My refrigerator did not arrive with any obvious damage or dents. And the stainless steel is sweet.
 
 There is an acrylic coating on the stainless steel door, and it comes wrapped in plastic from the factory, like every stainless steel appliance. The reviewer below just removed the protective plastic wrapping.
