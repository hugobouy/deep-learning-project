<REVIEW>
This 70 pg. book was originally published in 1956 in the journal Psychoanalysis as "Psychoanalytic Observations on Chess and Chess Masters".  As one can derive from this title, the author has attempted to present us with a deeper understanding of certain chess masters using psychoanalysis, and in the process comes up with some interesting but also peculiar (in my opinion, at least) insights. In particular, Fine discusses the following players: Staunton, Anderssen, Morphy, Steinetz, Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, Euwe, and Botvinnik.  For someone not familiar with the personalities of these exceptional players, Fine's anecdotal accounts of their personalities and eccentricities is quite facinating.  What kind of made me leary was the general remarks that the author makes in regards to chess and chess players, and how in particular he seems to sexualize the purpose of chess.   For instance, on page 22 he states: "The profuse phallic symbolism of chess provides some fantasy gratification of the homosexual wish, particularly the desire for mutual masterbation.  This is, of course, completely repressed.  Checkmate may be seen as rendering the father impotent, again part of the homosexual complex."  Oh, really?  And here I thoight that chess was a game, to be played for fun and enjoyment, or in some cases competatively.  I can't quite remember ever feeling that it was the expression of a "desire for mutual masterbation"--well, how could I, because I can't, since I'm repressing it.  Well, that's just pure bunk, in my opinion.  Fortunately, this book isn't entirely like this, so it does have its merits, but it clearly isn't must-read chess literature.
