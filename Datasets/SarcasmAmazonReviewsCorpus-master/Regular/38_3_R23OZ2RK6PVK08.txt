<REVIEW>
I recently purchased this mixer because I was questioning whether or not to purchase the much-celebrated Kitchen-Aid Artisan Mixer.  My reasoning: "for far less money, I'll purchase this mixer and see how often I really use it, and if it warrants a larger purchase in a year or two."  
 I opened the box and promptly made a batch of cookies which turned out delicious!  Two weeks later I made cupcakes and the batter was COMPLETELY smooth, no lumps and NO handmixing.  I really enjoy that the bowl spins while mixing, the power is substantial, and it is not a large appliance and can be left out on the counter if desired.
 I haven't used the dough hooks yet, but plan to make pizza with it soon, perhaps I'll add to this review at that time.
 For now, I am completely satisfied with this purchase and would definitely recommend it to occasional bakers who don't want to shell out three times as much $$ for something they will only use a few times a year.
