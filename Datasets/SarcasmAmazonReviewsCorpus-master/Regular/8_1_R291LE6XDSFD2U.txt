<REVIEW>
I have a smaller PC compressor in the shop that is very LOUD, so expected this one to be as well, especially since some of the other reviews found it so. But it's not much louder than the two-stage oillube compressor it replaced. I needed something that could be moved in a pinch, something that could run off 110V 15A service I have in the garage, and something with enough capacity to run my air ratchets, cut off tools, etc. I bought this unit fully expecting to have to wait for it to catch up occasionally, but it's kept up just fine.
 
 The only complaint I have with the unit is the difficulty of reaching the drain cock at the bottom of the tank. Next spring when it warms up I might replace that with an Ell and a ball valve. It also draws the full 15 amps, so plug it into a run that nothing else is pulling from.
 
 Overall I'm very satisfied with this unit.
