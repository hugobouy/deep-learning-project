<REVIEW>
I've been buying these wipes for over a year now, never had a weird smell to them. They are very moist, which is great for removing diaper cream off of your fingers before you can get to the sink. Overall great wipes, I just wish that I could order the refill without the plastic tub (we've accumulated so many now), I just don't feel right throwing them away, but I don't know what else to do with them.
