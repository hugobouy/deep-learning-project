<REVIEW>
My boyfriend thought it would be funny, so he picked one up at Walgreens and gave it to me. 
 
 It started out as a joke, but guess what? I actually ended up liking this thing - a lot! I've had it for almost a year and I use it all the time (when the weather is chilly). The material is thin, and it looks cheap. I was not impressed with it when I first saw it, but after using it I discovered that even though it is thin, it's still really warm. I have washed it many times and it is still in great condition. It's soft and my dog really likes snuggling with me when I use it. 
 
 The other day we went to Petsmart and discovered the dog Snuggie. Of course my boyfriend had to get it. It was supposed to be another joke. Me and my dog with matching Snuggies! I honestly did not expect my dog to wear it, but he really loves it too. He won't let me take it off. The box is really funny. There is a picture of a dog relaxing on the couch with his remote control and another picture of a couple of dogs playing backgammon. (I'm easily ammused, I suppose)
 
 In summary, it started out as a joke. The Snuggie has provided me with lots of laughs. But more importantly, I love my Snuggie because it does what it says it will do - it keeps me warm and comfortable, and yet, my hands are free!
