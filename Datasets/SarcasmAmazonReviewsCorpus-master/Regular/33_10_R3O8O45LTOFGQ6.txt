<REVIEW>
This is a great "lite" power tool to have around the house. For handling screws, drilling drywall, etc, it's excellent. The battery life is really good and the multitude of torque settings are useful. However, if you're wanting to do some serious home improvement projects, you should look elsewhere. I've found it to be a bit anemic when dealing with anything other than soft wood or drywall. If you need to drill metal, concrete, or tile this definitely will not get the job done adequately. I'm happy with it for what it is, which is a great tool for small jobs at a great price.
