<REVIEW>
I purchased this tool to become more familiar with my cycles. Ouch isn't something you really want to feel when you use a speculum. It may not be the most comfortable situation but it should not *hurt*. It's really appalling how many fake "funny or joke reviews" are on this subject. It's sad that a women's health tool has to be the subject of objectification or a joke. I truly encourage all the women I know to get more in touch with their cycles and their cervix. Empower yourself! It's a beautiful thing. A speculum is a wonderful tool!!  I purchased this to become more familiar with my cycles and to also become more familiar with my cervix. You can tell SO much about ovulation by checking your cervix. When you are TTC, this is invaluable. It's a relatively inexpensive tool. 
 
 Anyways, this speculum was *not* what I expected at all. One of the blades was much shorter than the other making it impossible to insert. No matter how much lube I used, or how relaxed I was, it wouldn't insert itself comfortably. I chose to buy this one instead of plastic for environmental reasons but I regret the decision as I cannot even use it. I have since ordered a pack of plastic speculums and already used one of those. It fit SO much more comfortably. I was hoping I didn't have to buy plastic but I did. 
 
 The shipper did get the item to me in a timely manner so if you'd like to try it for yourself, you can count on fast shipping. 
 
 Would definitely not make this purchase again based on the ease of use of this speculum. It hurt too much and I have a pretty decent tolerance for discomfort. 
 
 (this all may be TMI but what did you expect in a product review for a speculum?)
