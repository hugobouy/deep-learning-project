<PRODUCT>14k White Gold, Round, Diamond Stud Earrings (1/2 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity) (Jewelry)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
I would recommend these earrings to anyone. Yes, they are I3 clarity, which means that there are visible flaws. However, these diamonds go on your ear, not your hand, and for that reason I think that they make an excellent value for diamond earrings. The diamonds are sufficiently colorless, and I would definitely buy them again for myself or for a gift (although perhaps not for  someone who is very picky about diamonds).
