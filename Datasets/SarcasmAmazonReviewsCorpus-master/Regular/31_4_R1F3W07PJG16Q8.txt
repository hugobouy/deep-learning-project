<REVIEW>
I've had this head unit for almost a year now, the first 6 months were really good. The unit has some great features and it's priced well.. I was happy, then one day it wouldn't tune in my favorite FM radio stations. All my presets just wouldn't tune in.. there was nothing but static. I was confused because it just happened.. with no apparent reason and other stations would still come in fine. After playing with the unit and trying to figure it out, a buddy suggested I try to reset the head unit (a small button behind the face plate) and sure enough... that did it, I could receive my favorite channels again. 
 
 As a follow up, I've had this unit for a couple years now and I love it.. really a great head unit. A great value!
