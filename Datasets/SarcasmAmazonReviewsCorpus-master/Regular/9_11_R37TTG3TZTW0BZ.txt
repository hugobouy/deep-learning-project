<REVIEW>
So many of the reviews are more about the character's actions- I'd prefer to actually discuss the book.  My sister just started high school, she's 15 and she lent New Moon and the first book, Twilight to me.  Despite our age gap (I'm sixteen years older) I found them a very engaging and entertaining read.  I'm glad to share these with her and I'd suggest them to anyone who is staring at a younger, somewhat mysterious female relative wondering what to buy them for Christmas.
 
 The pacing is good.  The book is a quick, satisfying read.  My feeling is that the author works through scenes rather than writing in a linear fashion- and the scenes are fairly cinematic in their structure which I personally like.  She gets to the point in her stories and fits a lot of action and significant detail in without overwhelming you with a density of vision.  
 
 If you're concerned about the content, as in "Is this appropriate to give my neice/cousin's kid etc" you can be assured that the romantic tension captured here is through restraint rather than exploration.  Not too surprizingly this is highly seductive.  Several reviews seem disappointed by the character's actions and have given fewer stars.  However, I'd like to say that this book is clearly part of a larger work and we're seeing Bella at a certain point in her personal growth.  It is not a conclusion novel so it doesn't feel like one.  She acts like, well, a confused person in love.  I think the depiction is honest and it is a good thing when a character can annoy or drive you crazy: it means you're engaged and the author has done their job well.
 
 I'll be honest- I wasn't expecting to be drawn in, now I'm a bit annoyed I have to wait until next fall.  
 
 New Moon is the sequel to Twilight, so I'm covering both in my review.  I think it could stand alone but I'd stronly recommend reading Twilight first as it really gives the foundations and 'rules' of Bella's world.
