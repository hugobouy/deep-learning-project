<PRODUCT>LG Neon GT365 Prepaid GoPhone (AT&T) with $50 Airtime Credit (Wireless Phone)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
I bought this phone to replace one I had that wasn't working well.  I need to say though that I do not use this with a gophone plan.  I have a regular family plan with AT&T and of course the customer service will not tell you that you can use a gophone as a replacement.  If you aren't eligible for an upgrade they will tell you that you have to buy one at full price, usually $200 & up.  Gophones work just fine, just don't use the sim card that comes with it, put in the one from your old phone.  It actually has directions inside the package that tells you how to use the gophone with your regular plan, and they credit the $50 airtime as like an extra 150 minutes to your plan.  As far as the phone, I couldn't be happier.  The slide feature is great with the qwerty keyboard and the battery life has been great.  We have three LG phones in our plan and they all use the same chargers, which is very convenient.
