<REVIEW>
If you love 80's cartoon series you are probably very familiar with He-Man, but if not you MUST see this.  It's a terrific television series with enough depth to surpass most current television cartoons.  If you are familiar with He-Man this set is a way better choice than the 10 best episode collection.  The set includes many of the terrific episodes included in the 10 best and has many that finished just out of the top 10 (as voted by fans and supporters of he-man.org).  The cost of this collection is only 60% more than that of the 10-best and contains nearly five times the material.  Special features are great, and you won't get sick of watching several of these episodes over again.  Also, the stories are wholesome and are not seeking chances for clever inuendos like some current cartoon series, so that they are appropriate for young children as well.
