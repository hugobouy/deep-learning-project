<REVIEW>
No, doubt the far left will be outraged over Laura Ingraham's "The Obama Diaries."  I think Laura Ingraham has brilliantly exposed the Obama Regime's hypocrisy of change you can believe in.  The Diaries are done in the tradition of Alice in Wonderland.  You know Ms. Ingraham has hit a nerve when the lame stream media i.e. MSNBS, ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN are outraged by the Diaries. Laura Ingraham is right on in demonstrating the total disconnect between the American People and the alternate Obama Universe of trashing are traditional values, and dividing our Nation on racial grounds and class warfare. I am sure that Obama Diaries will be a best seller, to the dismay of Ms. Ingraham's Critics. Ms. Ingraham Critics should remember the more they condemn the Obama Diaries the more books will be sold. I am sure Ms. Ingraham is laughing as she goes to the bank.  Job, well done Laura.
