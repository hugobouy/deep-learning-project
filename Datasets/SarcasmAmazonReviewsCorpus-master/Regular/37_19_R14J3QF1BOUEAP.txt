<REVIEW>
I am SO happy to finally have a bathroom scale that WORKS!  My old Taylor scale was just crap.  Seriously.  I lost so much motivation because of that thing, it would give me different weights anywhere within a 5-pound "range" every time I stepped on it, so I never had any idea what I actually weighed, or whether or not my hard work was paying off.  Drove me nuts!  
 
 Because of that, I put my new EatSmart scale through a lot of "tests" when I got it today.  I stepped on it 5 times in a row, alternating between it and the old Taylor scale each time.  The old scale gave me 5 completely different numbers, as usual, but the EatSmart stayed the same each time!  I even tried putting the laundry basket on it in between weighs, to make sure it wasn't just "remembering" the last number.  Nope!  So then I tried drinking a big glass of water, and sure enough, the EatSmart registered a .6 pound increase.  Fantastic!  I'm so pleased with the consistency and accuracy of this scale.  I'm feeling 100x more energized and motivated than I was yesterday, because I know now I'll be able to see the REAL results of my actions, good or otherwise.  :)
