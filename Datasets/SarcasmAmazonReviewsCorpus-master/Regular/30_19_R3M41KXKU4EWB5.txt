<REVIEW>
Anthropology of an American Girl is poignantly true to the time, the place and the culture of the East End of Long Island. This coming-of-age novel, refreshingly free of shame, blame and guilt, describes the indescribable world-rocking nuance of sexual thrall.  Readers cannot help but re-live their own urgent youth and will envy Eveline's power to consciously surrender herself to love.  The characters are drawn brilliantly, and we believe every word and deed in this remarkable book. Ms. Hamann is also objectively honest in her description of the darkest pockets of a young community, such as casual rape, incidental violence, and drugs.  In the end the reader is satisfied and believes in humanity.  This is a wonderful book.
