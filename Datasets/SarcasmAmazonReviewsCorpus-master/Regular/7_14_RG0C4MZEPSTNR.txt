<REVIEW>
ALthough &quot;The Village&quot; did have wonderful cinematography and an underlying story of facing your fears for the ones you love, I expected it to be a horror movie. I was waiting for some sense of action or suspense in the movie and this did not happen once. This was the first movie that I almost fell asleep watching. I was ready for it to finish. I'm glad that I saw it on employee preview night. It just went on and on. Thats just IMHO though. If you liked &quot;Signs&quot; or any of the book to movie adaptations of Bronte, I recommend this movie.
