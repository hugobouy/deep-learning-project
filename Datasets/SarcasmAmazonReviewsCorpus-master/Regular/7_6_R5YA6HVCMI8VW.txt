<REVIEW>
 M.A.S. Abdel Haleem's English translation of the Qur'an is the best that I have seen. Some of the other English translations available, use awkward forms and archaic words that are difficult and tedious for the modern reader. But Haleem's translation is easy to read, yet scholarly. His footnotes, chapter intro's, and the historical background preface, is highly informative to the western reader; who may not be familiar with the history of Islam.
 
 My problem is not with the translation, it is with the book itself. For a supposedly holy book, the Qur'an is rife with errors. Take for example Chapter 20 (Ta Ha), where Pharaoh supposedly tells his magicians that for their betrayal to Moses, they'll be crucified. The Exodus took place around the 14th century B.C. however, crucifixion was not invented until the 6th century B.C. by the Persians. In chapter 58 (The Dispute) Allah permits lying, but he damns those who "knowingly" lie. Does that make any sense? The Quran also permits hitting women ch 4:34, lying (because Allah is a liar ch 3:54), Jihad (holy war against non-Muslims ch 3:168-175), and in no uncertain terms damns those who believe that Jesus is God (Christians) ch 4:170-173. The Qur'an is also very anti-Semitic. 
 
 The Qur'an does not even compare to the Bible in: reliability, historicity, complexity, beauty, or applicability. No, the Qur'an seems like a jumbled collection of chapters that are highly repetitive and lack any real sense of order or flow. The Allah of the Qur'an takes delight in damning the non-believers, and repeatedly states that those who "ascribe partners with God" (Christians and the Trinity for example), will be damned.
 
 Don't believe me? I took notes throughout the entire book, noting the errors, contradictions, and hateful theology that are found in the Qur'an. I challenge others to do the same.
 
 So people need to read the Qur'an before thinking that Islam and Christianity are compatible, because clearly they are not! The Jesus of the Qur'an is a prophet; the Jesus of the Bible is God, big difference people!! And it doesn't stop there! Haleem's translation is good, but the book that he translated is not!!!
