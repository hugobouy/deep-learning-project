<REVIEW>
wow, the detail over such a little thing.  Look, it works great.  does the job... no complaints and a hell of a lot better than the crappy ones i got drug stores branded with the name 'conair'.  those really stunk. The quality difference is night and day.  
 
 And, the light: you aren't supposed to use the light WHILE you are using it.  It's for inspection before and after.
