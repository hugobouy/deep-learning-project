<REVIEW>
this stand does not work with either of my bikes that have front disc brakes.  they do not fit.
 
 Also I found it to be of poor quality, using cheap hardware.  I had to use a tap and die set just to put it together and find out it sucks.  
 
 I returned it.  Amazon took care of the return no problem.
