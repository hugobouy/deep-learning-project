<REVIEW>
I didn't realize that the author of this book is also the same person that has the television show.  I don't regularly watch Nancy Grace on TV but I've caught it a few times when I was channel surfing.  Like when I've caught her on TV, I was glued to the book from the very beginning.  This book gives plenty of visual details and the writing flows easily.  It usually takes me a bit of time to warm up to a book and get to know the characters but this one had me from page one.  It is a quick read being only about 350 or so pages so to me it is like a good suspense thriller movie.  I am always looking for reading material to keep me on the treadmill and this fit the bill.   I liked it!
