<REVIEW>
I first bought these diapers for my daughter when she got her first bad diaper rash at about a month old.  It was one of those rashes that looked as though her skin had been set on fire and nothing seemed to be helping it.  I had tried everything and thought maybe these chlorine free diapers and wipes will do something for her.  To my amazement, her diaper rash went away within a day and a half of using the diapers and wipes from Seventh Generation.  I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it for myself!  I think that really speakes volumes about the danger of whatever chemicals being are put into the other diaper brands.  These are now the ONLY brand of diapers I will buy for my kids.
