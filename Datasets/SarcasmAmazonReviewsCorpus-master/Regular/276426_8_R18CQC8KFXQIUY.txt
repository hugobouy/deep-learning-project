<REVIEW>
I am a big fan of politicians who are, well, for the lack of a better phrase, not born with a silver spoon in her/his mouth.  When you have to work to pay for little things others take for granted, e.g. your own education, you have a true sense of what it takes to reach your goals in life.  For this reason, I admire people like Pres. Clinton and Gov. Palin greatly.  Clinton's "My Life" is one of my all-time favorite autobiographies.  
 
 As I read through this book, it became clear to me, much like Pres. Clinton, Mrs. Palin is far from a perfect human being and she has not been without fault.  To her credit, she did not try to hide everything in the book.  She admitted to many of the mistakes she made during the campaign and her life in general, and she tried to give a hindsight review of what went wrong and how she should/would have done differently, although I wish she had played less of the blame game in the book overall.  As a political moderate, I can't say I always agree with Gov. Palin's opinions and stances on different issues, but I respect her because she formed them based on her own personal beliefs and experiences and did not blindedly follow "party leaders".  The book also was Gov. Palin's first fair chance to explain some of the controversies that plagued her VP campaign, including the Troopergate, the Couric interview, the pregnancies (both herself and Bristol) and many more stories we never heard.  Whether or not you want to take her words with a grain of salt, it at least is her side of the story that the media never presented us.
 
 All in all, a very good read that took us from her childhood days in Alaska as a tomboy who loved sports and outdoors, to her struggles in early adulthood with her husband and children, and eventually to her glamorous appearance along side Sen. McCain on the campaign trails.  Whether you agree with her politics, I think this book presents much we could learn from her life.
 
 This is my honest review of the book and how much I enjoyed it, not the person or her political positions.  I pre-ordered on Kindle and finished in a little less than two days.
