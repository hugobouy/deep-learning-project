<REVIEW>
I, like many, was very interested in this woman's journey. I kept reading hoping that there would be a moment when the author would reveal some revelation or personal growth out of her horrible circumstances. However, the book was unorganized and pointless. I found the author to be a typical academic stuck in a library and unaware of how to relate to the real world. Her condescension towards her heritage and anyone that isn't "brilliant" is ironic since she has made some really pathetic personal decisions in her life. I also was offended by what seemed to be her disdain for Christianity, which showed her true lack of understanding of it. I do not recommend this book, and I would be, quite frankly, embarrassed to pass it along. I found her comments about her own people disrespectful. And finally, as others have mentioned, if you are going to read it, have a dictionary standing by.
