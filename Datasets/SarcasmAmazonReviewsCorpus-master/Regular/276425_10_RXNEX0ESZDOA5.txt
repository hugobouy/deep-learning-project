<REVIEW>
I bought this scanner to scan in about 150 old black and white family photos, and they all came out very nicely. I scanned only a handful of color pictures, and they were fine as well.
 
 Some experiences I had using the scanner:
 - smaller pictures end up getting a better final resolution
 - the quality is great for pictures, but only average for text; for example newspaper articles don't scan well enough to allow you to read smaller text
 - I was able to scan aout 30 pictures in an hour
 - scanning multiple photos is usually easy: you don't have to crop a big image into the individual photos because the scanning software figures out the picture boundaries. However, occasionally the picture boundary detection stuff messes up and the scanner detects 1 fewer picture than was in the scanner, forcing you to rescan 
 
 For some old polaroids, the scanned picture was clearer and brighter than the polaroid. it brought out the picture in
 an amazing way.
