<REVIEW>
I've been using the TurboScratcher since it came out in the early 80s as a toy and scratching item for my cats.  I have NEVER paid for than about $12-13 for it, and the inserts used to be available from WalMart for 3/$9.  The catnip helps get the attention for the scratching part, and once the see how much fun it is to scratch, they rarely go back to carpet or furniture.  I've had more than one cat that never ONCE went for furniture because I made sure he/she had her own turbo-scratcher from the moment they arrived in my house.  I have one that is a light blue from back in the 80s when everything was light blue and mauve.  If left in the sun a bit too long, they do tend to get a little brittle, but while they feel a little flimsy, they are perfect for the cats.  For those without carpet -- use the rubber shelf or drawer liner cut in a square or circle a couple of inches bigger than the whole toy and it doesn't move at all.  I have never had any problem on any surface until I recently moved into a house with handscraped hardwood floors that are uneven.  This trick worked wonders there and I suspect it would have been more stable on the tile floor in our last house as well, but our cat like to sleep on it in the window in the sun just as much as playing or scratching it.  I recommend one to any cat that I adopt out at rescue, and for my foster babies, I give one to the family that adopts them because that's what I teach them to scratch on and I don't want them developing bad habits of scratching furniture or carpet in their new home -- where they are often trying to cope with the unfamiliar.  I've been told by my adoptive families that this was a really great thing to send esp since it was familiar and they were surprised at how much it was used.  Before replacing the cardboard circle, make sure you turn it over and use both sides!  if they seem a little bored and you are out of catnip, just pic up a little bag of it and it will totally get their attention again.
