<REVIEW>
I've been following these guys since their Tom Goes To The Mayor days.  I think they're both brilliant and obviously a host of celebrities the likes of John C. Reilly, Jeff Goldblum and Patten Oswald think so too.  I can understand though how some people wouldn't like it.  It's one of those love it or hate it shows.  Tom Goes To The Mayor was great but Awesome Show is on a whole new level.  I am hopelessly addicted.  I just heard it got picked up for another 3 seasons by Cartoon Network.  Thank you Lord!!!
