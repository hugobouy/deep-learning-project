<REVIEW>
I loved this book.  Loved it.  I feel that it was very much in synch with Ms. Harris' earlier works in the series where the cohesion comes from a single mystery that runs like a river under the various plotlines (some resolved and some to be resolved).  Also unifying the whole, was the theme of 'family' which allowed us to get to know our favorite characters on a deeper level --really nice at this late stage in the series.
 
 The character developement overall in this installment was spot on and brilliant (ie: Taking one of the series' new characters a full, believable, 180 degrees from sympathetic to psycho). Sookie is still our beloved Sookie, her black humor and sass intact, but now with some welcome maturation and self awareness (Take that Stephanie Plum!)and an ability to actually have some empathy and concern for Eric --oh, and now she will "stake a b***h" if you mess with her or her man! Speaking of whom, it's still our beloved Machiavellian Eric, but now he's realizing that he's got to be more open and honest if Sookie's going to trust him.  
 
 There's a return of the likable Bill for Bill fans. (Yay old Bill! Give him a woman he can mollycoddle and talk adorably stilted to for pity's sake.)  And even Sam was awesome and cool --his interactions with Sookie comforting and welcome instead of the yawn fest they've been lately.  It was also nice to have Jason back to being Sookie's big brother and comic relief rather than the absent ne'er do well.
 
 The author was on her game with her descriptions and dialogue as well.  Some favorite quotes that come quickly to mind, "...he was not a happy camper.  Well, he could pitch his tent right alongside mine." and "That looks painful.  Would you like me to nurse it?" (Honestly, the book deserves 5 stars alone for the "chair" scene and Pam calling Sookie "monkey girl"  --too much wicked fun.)  I laughed aloud throughout the book.
 
 Finally, there were a few "True Blood" shoutouts which I really enjoyed (and I include among these, a flipping of Eric's Maker storyline on it's head --way to own it, Ms. Harris, and give us something new along with a sly nod and a wink) and some clever references to past Sookie short stories --nice rewards for the faithful fan.
