<REVIEW>
I bought this CD soon after becoming engaged to my fiance (now husband) and immediently fell in love with I Do (Cherish You) and my husband liked it as well. We had it played at our wedding and it is still my favorite  song. Besides I Do, Because of You is a beautiful song. Wonderful singers,  they do a fantastic job!
