I've had my Kindle 2 since 2/24 and I loved it at first.
 
 Today is the first day when we have had bright sunshine, so I took the Kindle out in the sun and was dismayed to see that the text (particularly near the center of the screen) faded within seconds. Alt-G refresh of the screen restored the text temporarily but further sun exposure resulted in screen fading.  This is not a problem with the Kindle 1.
 
 Ever since I got the Kindle 2, its text has been lighter than my K1, but not so much that I couldn't tolerate it The fading in sunlight makes the text virtually unreadable.
 
 I contacted customer support (and mind you I have the extended warranty that allegedly give you advance replacement) and was told that A REPLACEMENT WOULD NOT FIX EITHER OF THE PROBLEMS and that what I should do if I were dissatisfied is simply return the Kindle 2 and all the accessories I ordered for it.
 
 Needless to say, I am a very unhappy camper. If replacing my current K2 will not fix the problem, then that means that 
 
 a) they have not identified the source of the problem and 
 b) that any K2 currently purchased will have a similarly defective screen.
 
 My advice: STAY AWAY FROM THE KINDLE 2 at least until Amazon acknowledges there is a problem and provides a fix. For me, I plan to stay away from the Kindle 2 forever. 
 
 Thank heavens I didn't sell my Kindle 1!!
 
 ADDENDUM:  Following the events above, I sent feedback to Amazon about how dissatisfied I was with Customer Support.  The next day I did get a call back from someone else in Kindle support who agreed to send a replacement Kindle 2 out ASAP.  It should arrive Tuesday and I will post followup once I have a chance to check it out in bright sun.  FWIW, however, I have decided to hang onto my K1 just in case.
 
 ADDENDUM 2:  After two replacements, I finally got a K2 that does reasonably well in terms of the darkness of the text and one on which the text does not fade in the sun.  I say "reasonably well" because the text is still noticeably lighter than the text on my K1.  
 
 Despite the lighter text, I prefer the K2 for its thinness and its improved navigation and I use if far more than my K1.
