<REVIEW>
Funny, everyone seems so thrilled about how they come charged out of the box.  While this is nice and convenient, the bigger picture is *why* they can come charged out of the box: they discharge at a much slower rate than normal (NiMH) rechargeable batteries.  If you use your battery-needing product often, you may not notice this, but for things you use sporadically, this is a godsend.  No more coming home from vacation to find your TV remote control is dead.  No more grabbing your digital camera after three weeks of not using it only to find it won't start up.  
 
 These batteries are, indeed, the best of both worlds: they have the power and reuse advantages of a good NiMH battery, but the slow steady discharge of an Alkaline disposable.  Look no further -- this is the rechargeable you've been waiting for.
 
 And if you had to guess, I'm happy with my first set and about to order more... :)
