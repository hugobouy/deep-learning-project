<REVIEW>
Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl tells of a young Jewish girl's experiences through adolescence in the midst of World War II and Hitler's genocide against her people.  On her thirteenth birthday, she was given a  diary in which to write her thoughts and feelings.  She, her family, the  Van Daan family, and Dr. Dussel tried to adjust to life in the Secret  Annexe.  Her diary, which she named Kitty, was written from her heart with  no superficiality.  This makes reading it a great experience. 	She  discussed in the book many issues prevalent in her life as a Jew.  She  talked about the Zionist movement and the hardships Jews endured in Nazi  Germany.  They could only shop in certain stores designated for Jewish use.   She wrote about her father and sister's fear of deportation, which would  have almost definitely resulted in going to a deadly concentration camp. 	 It is a good read because of the way it intertwines childhood and the  Holocaust and speaks of both candidly.  She wrote about her feelings and  encounters with friends and family.  She let out her anger at Hitler and  described the new reforms that made her life much harder.  She thought she  had found a good friend in Kitty.  Little did she know that one day her  story would impact thousands around the world, even if she was only a young  girl.
