<REVIEW>
This is one of my top 10 favorite books EVER!  From their first amazingly hot encounter to the heart-wrenching conclusion I was hooked.  Regardless of the graphic nature of their sexual encounters and the explicit language, Lisa Valdez has written a compelling and well plotted story.  I appreciate that the author has revealed that the sex scenes are actually integral, and metaphorical, to the character's needs and their relationship with each other.  Mark, the Earl of Langley, has never been embraced or loved deeply by another woman and Passion is unfulfilled/unfilled--and both find their needs truly met in each other.  Understanding this may help a more reticent reader move beyond the shocking beginning and into the dynamic storyline that is alternately tragic and triumphant.  Readers may need to keep a box of tissues nearby during the last third of the novel. :)
