<REVIEW>
I though the Da Vinci Code was a good book. It did have it's faults...I don't think that it was all that well-written. I also feel like the characters spent most of the book displaying or explainint their characterization rather than just "being themselves." However, it was a very enthralling story. It grabs the reader's interest and doesn't let go. Anyone who has an interest in art, history, or even cospiracy theories would like this book. I'm not saying that everything in the book is historical fact...don't get me wrong...but some of it is. There is a lot of factual information in the book...especially concerning Leonardo Da Vinci. I would recommend reading the Illustrated Edition, especially for anyone who is unfamiliar with a lot of art. This edition includes photographs of all of the paintings, sculptures, buildings, and drawings that are mentioned in the book. It is extremely helpful in understanding what is being read.
