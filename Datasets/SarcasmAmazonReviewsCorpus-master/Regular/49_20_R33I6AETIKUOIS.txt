<REVIEW>
I purchased this product for my 20 month old son to use on a 800 mile car trip. It was very helpful for giving him small snacks like cereal, and crackers while on the road. Much easier than handing him one piece at a time! The tray wiped clean very easily. There were some crumbs in the corners, but we just shook them out into the trash. It was also good for small toys and books. I like that it is made out of a soft, but durable material, which makes it safe in case of a car accident. The material feels like the padded shoulder straps of a backpack. It is lightweight, and my son didn't seem to mind it. He even fell asleep with the tray in place. This tray will go with us on every car trip in the future!
