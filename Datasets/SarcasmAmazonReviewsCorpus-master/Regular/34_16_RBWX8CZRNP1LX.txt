<REVIEW>
I just received two of these. For the money, this is the best technology imaginable.  The sound quality is superb for such a small device. The controls and plugs are easily accessible and easy to use.  They are very well designed and to my tastes attractive while on display.  They fold up into a little cube for packing. I have wanted an easy way to listen to my iPod Nano while doing other things, like working on my bonsai collection in the garden. Earphones are a pain unless I am driving.  I tried to stream podcasts from my netbook, but the built in speakers were woefully weak, and the form factor was a pain to have to move around.  I'm ordering two more.  They are well built and can plug into any "headphone" output of desktop, laptop, netbook, iPod.  I have one desktop computer without speakers. Now I can have this little unit plugged in for audio and power to the desktop with it perfectly nestled under the LCD, and listen to stuff that I had to use earphones for previously.  You see, I already have two sets of speakers connected to other computers in the same work area for high quality sound should I ever need it.  Music even sounds great on these little speakers.  Get some while you can!
