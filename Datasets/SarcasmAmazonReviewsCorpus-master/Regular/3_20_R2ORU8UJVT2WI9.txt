<REVIEW>
After smash hit Pon de Replay, hit single If It's Loving (which bowed Top 20 in several countries) and a very eclectic dance album Music Of The Sun in her career, Rihanna got herself too much to work on it. Hearing SOS (Rescue Me) is a relief because goes beyond Pon De Replay and give Riha chance to explore on a more underground beat area. The albun which intented give Rihanna a break from reggea and dancehall (which aren't missing but few songs are still influenced by) and give her a step up to R&B area. 
 
 Dem Haters and Sean Paul's duo Break It Off prooved to be hit singles when I heard them, good dance beat zone. Rihanna never miss on that but she's got working on do on songs like Crazy Little Thing or Kisses or tittle track which take the album on the ewww zone! Really she could do much better.
 
 R&B area was overwhelming on Unfaithful and PS (Still Not Over You) which are singles prototypes and remixes of If It's and Pon give the album a complement. 
 
 Like Music Of The Sun the album tries to get every single rythim available since reggea to R&B to underground dace beat but still have to see that Rihanna is an expert on dance tracks and very cool ballad girl. She must keep on that. Next album she'll do some hard rock if she keeps 'exploring' as record company sais.
