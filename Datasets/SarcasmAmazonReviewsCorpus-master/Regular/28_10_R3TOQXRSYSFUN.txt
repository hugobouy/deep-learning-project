<REVIEW>
I can't believe someone would actually want to read about some the grotesque & obscene gestures going on throughout the book. I found it not only confusing with the way the author jumped around form event to event, but down right salacious in content & depressing as well. In my opinion reading is suppose to be either an adventure that takes you out of the ordinary life, or informative. This was just down right excess jibber jabber. It was overboard & weird! 
 No thank you... I will not read another book by this author again anytime soon!
