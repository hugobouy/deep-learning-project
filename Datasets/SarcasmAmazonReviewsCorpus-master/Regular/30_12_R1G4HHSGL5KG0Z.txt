<REVIEW>
If your interested in the paranormal, this series will not let you down.
 The various cases are interesting, Buell & his cast actually have screen presence by just being themselves, and the outcome of each episode is not always predictable.
 I've viewed Ghost Adventures & Ghost Hunters, and similar themed programs, yet none have the overall appeal this series consistently offers.
 As i pre-ordered "Season three," here on Amazon, i was also knocked out by the low, low price!
 You simply can't go wrong for value & entertainment.
