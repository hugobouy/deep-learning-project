<REVIEW>
WE OWN ONE OF THESE FANS, WE BOUGHT IT FOR OUR SON WHICH IS A BIG FAN OF BASEBALL AND WE HAVE NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT IN THE 3 PLUS YEARS THAT WE  HAVE HAD IT. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FAN COULD CAUSE DAMAGE IF IT IS NOT INSTALLED CORRECTLY. OTHER THAN THAT IT OPERATES AND IS A WELL MADE CEILING FAN. OF COURSE, ANY FAN YOU BUY, IF IT IS NOT INSTALLED PROPERLY YOU WILL HAVE PROBLEMS. THE CEILING FAN IS MADE BY HUNTER AND ALL OF THEIR CEILING FAN PRODUCTS HAVE A LIFETIME WARRANTY. ANYWAYS I JUST WANT TO LET IT BE KNOWN THAT IT IS A GREAT CEILING FAN.
