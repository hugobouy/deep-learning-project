<REVIEW>
I have been a long time user of the Gillette Manual Fusion Razor then I bought a ProGlide Power Razor about 2 weeks before it was actually released and all I can say is WOW...this razor is by far the best razor out there today, no doubt about it...This razor makes shaving a breeze and it does not drag across your face, nick or cut you in any way...it provides the closest shave you can possibly get without going into an "old-school" barber and getting a straight razor shave..Yes, the blades are expensive but you really do "Get What You Pay For" so if you want cheap blades then expect a lousy shave with cuts and knicks..if you want an extremely close and comfortable shave with minimal effort then this is the razor for you...I recommend getting the Power Razor as it really does make a difference while shaving and it does provide a closer shave than a manual razor..Also, get rid of that crap-in-a-can gel or foam and get yourself some natural cream that you lather with a badger brush (Truefitt & Hill, Proraso, etc) and you will really see this ProGlide Power come to life..A+++ razor that I will continue to use no matter the cost of the blades...Face it, us dudes have to shave daily (or almost daily) so why go cheap and tear up your face if you do not have to..
