<REVIEW>
We use cloth diapers, but when we want to use a 'sposie, we love Seventh Generation.  He also has gotten bad diaper rashes from other 'sposie brands, but the Seventh Generation are as kind to his skin as his cloth dipes!  As he's gotten older, wet diapers bother him more, so I'm ordering some Seventh Generations to put on him for nighttime so that I can hopefully start getting more uninterrupted sleep (please, please, God, let this work).  They're definitely absorbent enough to last all night, even on the nights that he spends nursing every two hours.  They're also nice and trim - he's a slender guy, and it's  nice that we can find a good fit that isn't too bulky!
 
 Do I wish they were as cheap as generic disposables?  Absolutely!  But, not to put too fine a point on it, I feel my suspicions about the safety of the products used to make those have been confirmed.  It never fails that after we use them, if we have to borrow a dipe at a playdate or similar situation, my son has a red, sunburn-like rash all over his bottom, which goes away with a little bit of salve and a switch back to Seventh Generations or cloth.  From now until potty training, I'm staying stocked up on the Seventh Generations.
