<REVIEW>
We had the original CatGenie for over a year with 3 cats in the house and loved the lack of cat odors and ease of maintenance. The maximum 4 daily cycles did use up cartridges in about 2 weeks, and we ran out frequently. We also started having to disassemble and clean it more often as time went on,and it finally just stopped working. We got the 120 version, and what an improvement! The cat activation mode really extends cartridge life significantly, and the(4)cats got used to it quickly. I highly recommend this version to anyone with multiple cats. It's a time and money saver.
