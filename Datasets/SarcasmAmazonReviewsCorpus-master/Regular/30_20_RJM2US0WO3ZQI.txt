<REVIEW>
I was a huge fan of her historicals and thought I would read her contemporary novel but this novel was awful.  No character development, plot was silly and very unrealistic. I will not be reading anymore Julie Garwood contemporary and since that is all that she writes now; then I will be reading NO Julie Garwood.
