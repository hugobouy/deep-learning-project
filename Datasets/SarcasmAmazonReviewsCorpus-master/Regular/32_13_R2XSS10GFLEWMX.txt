<REVIEW>
Really impressed! There is a big problem with most inclusive systems, this has all the benefits, best of both worlds. boasting a staggering 5 HDMI inputs, it has specific steetings for T.V., music, and multiple gaming settings from Action and RPG to Rock and Sports....which is very cool! Ii has an iPod dock, which I was happy to see that you can play movies off of the ipod with no resolution issues. I haven't used the tunner yet, really no need. Really easy lay out, looks great. FYI the subwoofer is HUGE! I thought it would fit on the lower self on my entertainment system.....not going to happen. SUPER AWESOME unlike the other system it play music every bit as good as my brothers Dennon which he dropped almost $2K on.
