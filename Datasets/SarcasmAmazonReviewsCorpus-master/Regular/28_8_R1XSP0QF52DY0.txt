<REVIEW>
I recently bought the C75 Beertender as we prepare for the fall football season and we love it- here's why.
 *	Heineken is the beer of choice in our house, so when we saw the mini draught kegs in the grocery store, we knew this would be a nice alternative to the bottles and cans we normally buy for our gatherings. 
 *	I am a big a fan of Krups products; I've always used a Krups coffee maker; I can't live without the pannini grill and recently purchased the fully automatic espresso machine- which we love. When I saw the Beertender, I knew we had to have one in our house. 
 *	We have beer on tap all the time! Does it get any better then that? The beer stays at the perfect temperature, it doesn't take up any room in our refrigerator and it tells us when the keg needs to be replaced, if we exceed the 30 day freshness period. (So far we have drained the kegs before that date happens but we have come close)
 
 I'm thinking this will be a great present for all the beer lovers in our families.
