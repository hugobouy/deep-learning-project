<PRODUCT>Pinzon Microtec Throw (Kitchen)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
I bought this for hubby dear to keep warm when he plays his video games or while watching a movie. The throw is not as soft as I expected but it definitely makes up for that in terms of warmth. We really wish it were longer so we could snuggle in it together but it definitely is worth the price I paid for it ($12). My toddler started hogging the throw once she discovered how snuggly it felt and I bought her one for her very own, with which she is extremely pleased! It's the perfect size when used as a toddler blanket and she's kept very warm during cold Wisconsin winter nights.
