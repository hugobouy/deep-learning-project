<PRODUCT>Extended Cordless Phone Battery For Uniden BT-905 BT-800 NIMH 1800Mah</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
My wife has the habit of leaving the cordless phone off the charger, so naturally, once the old battery wouldn't hold a charge anymore, I needed a new one.  This battery went into a uniden phone and it seems to be taking all of my wife's abuse in stride.  Everytime I need the phone now and can find where it's hidden, there is ALWAYS enough juice left to make my calls.  I am very happy with this purchase
