<PRODUCT>Arrogant Armies: Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them (Hardcover)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
This is a wonderful book. The author has a great sense of irony. He skillfully blends contemporary records and journals written by soldiers at  all levels of the hierarchy to show the incompetence of the &quot;arrogant  armies&quot; he's describing. This book goes very well with &quot;March of  Folly&quot; by Barbara Tuchman. It's unfortunate that amazon.com does not  list this book as a suggestion on this page. I just wish he would include  more examples from 1914-1989 years. I don't really understand why there's a  gap between the old European imperial period all the way up to Somalia.  There were plenty of wars that would qualify for this book in between.
