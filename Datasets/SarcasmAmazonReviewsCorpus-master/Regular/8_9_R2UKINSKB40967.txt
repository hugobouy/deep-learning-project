<PRODUCT>Birth Control is Sinful in the Christian Marriages and also Robbing God of Priesthood Children!! (Paperback)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
First of all, I believe that children are a blessing as the Bible states. One blessing is that it keeps parents from living a self-centred life (a sin) and helps them become more like Jesus. I also firmly believe that having more children than you can take care of/support is a sin as well. When looking at the various types of birth control there are some that prevent fertilization and others that prevent implantation of the fertilized egg in the womb. The majority of pills do the later. Birth control using methods that prevent the embryo from living further breaks the commandment of "Thou shalt not kill" and constitutes a sin. I would love to hear what others think about these statements.
