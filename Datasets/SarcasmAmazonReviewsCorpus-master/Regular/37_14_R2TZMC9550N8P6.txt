<PRODUCT>KitchenAid K5ASBP Bowl for 5-Quart Professional Stand Mixer (Kitchen)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
If you do a lot of cooking or baking, an extra bowl will sure come in handy. But save yourself the headache and double-check your model number before ordering, since different models have different shaped bowls or mounting brackets. Here's the information I received directly from KitchenAid customer support:
 
 - this bowl #K5ASBP, is for 5 quart "Classic" mixers and fits models K5, KSM5, K5SS, and KP50PS
 - bowl #KN25PBH fits models that start with KG
 - bowl #KN25NSF fits models that start with KM
 - bowl #KN15PBEH only fits the discontinued "Accolade" mixers that start with KN15E1X.
 - The service person said that bowl #KN25WPBH is "incorrectly listed" on the KitchenAid website as a 5-quart bowl and that it is actually a 6-quart bowl for 6-quart mixers. I found a LOT of discrepancy regarding this when searching the internet, so I'd recommend you do a little more research or call KitchenAid at your time of purchase for confirmation.
