<REVIEW>
These are the only insoles I've tried that have taken away the awful burning pain in my feet and relieved the tired aching muscles in my calves and thighs. I stand for eight hours a day working on the casino floor so these insoles have given me the freedom to walk and stand pain free through an entire shift. They provide great arch and heel support.  Thank you Spenco for making a great product!
