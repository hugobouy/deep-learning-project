<REVIEW>
I bought this chandelier a few months ago for $83.99.  What a great value!  A note of caution: the instructions were amateurish - I would have appreciated more details since this was my first time installing a chandelier.  But a quick search online and I was able to find better instructions.  It ended up taking a couple of hours to assemble and install but it was well worth the time.  It looks fantastic in my dining room and the price is hard to beat.
