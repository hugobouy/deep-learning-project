<REVIEW>
We bought and applied this product when my son started teething.  It is VERY important to first thoroughly clean the surface where you plan on applying the strip with alcohol.  If there is any oily residue, the adhesive will not stay put.  Our son is now four, and our one-year-old daughter has inherited this crib.  The original rail protector is still in place and not so much as a corner has started to lift.
