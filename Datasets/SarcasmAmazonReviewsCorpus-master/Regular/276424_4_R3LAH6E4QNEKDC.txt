<REVIEW>
After having previous LEGO games dished out to us, here comes along "Harry Potter Years 1-4", an exciting achievement that stands out among a basket full of other bland eggs. I was instantly amazed by the beautiful graphics, clever dialogue, and the challenging gameplay. What makes this stand out from other Harry Potter games released in the past is that you have the ability to play as other characters: Ron, Hermione's cat, Hagrid, etc. Each character has their own special ability, as well as their own strengths and weaknesses, which adds some flare to the gameplay. What is also new about this addition is that a multiplayer mode has been included for more than just one player. 
 
 The premise is fairly simple that most of us are already aware of. It covers years 1-4 from J.K Rowling's popular book series based on a teenage wizard. The game moves smoothly over each storyline of the book and stays true to the source material: defeating Aragon from the Chamber of Secrets, all the way to casting the Patronus charm at Dementors in the Prisoner of Azkaban. Gameplay and controls are fairly simple as well and especially fun when you are casting spells with your Wii remote. Many of the challenges involve quick puzzle solving and exploring unknown territory, and can become quite difficult. The crisp graphics combined with the dynamic and elevating score used from the movies also provides us with a clear insight into Harry's wizarding LEGO world. 
 
 "Harry Potter: Years 1-4" is by the far the finest Harry Potter video game to hit the shelves, possibly the best LEGO game. It gives us a new gameplay experience that we have not yet experienced in a Harry Potter video game and yet still harnesses that ability to captivate us. But, what I love the most about it is that it has allowed me to revisit that childhood I remember as a kid when such things existed. It will certainly keep Harry Potter fans on their feet as well while providing a vivid blast from the past for all of us who enjoyed the previous first four installments.
