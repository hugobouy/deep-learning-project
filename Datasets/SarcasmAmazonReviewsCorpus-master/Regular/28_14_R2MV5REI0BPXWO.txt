<REVIEW>
Ok here we go for my first and probably only review on Amazon. I am 50 years old and have tried pretty much every electric shaver known to mankind. Each time giving up due to  the pinching,non close shave and pain in the butt cleaning. In the end, I was going back to razor blades and the frequent cuts. I went to Braun's website and read about this shaver and came to Amazon to see the reviews here. I decided after reading the reviews to splurge on another electric shaver.
 What a find! This in my humble opinion is the greatest invention EVER! It's the first electric razor I've used which doesn't get hot after a couple minutes of use.Hot razor means sweaty face which trips up razor and adds to pinching. Braun recommends you shave before you shower or wash your face, while you still have a little protective barrier of oil on your skin. A big no-no with regular shaving, this worked well with the Pulsonic. They also recommend you shave against the grain. Again, not recommended for regular shaving. For electric shaving, works great.
 
 I must say I Absolutely LOVE shaving now.(I would let my beard grow for days because I HATED shaving with razors and cutting myself). The Pulsonic is the closest shave ever by an electric razor(IMHO shaves as close as a razor once you master it) and more importantly it does not pinch or burn at all. Even better is the self cleaning which make life easier.
 My wife laughs every morning as she now sees me shaving daily with this god send! if you are reading bad reviews on this product it must be I just don't get it.
 Bottom line:  BUY THIS NOW! I just ordered another one for my son!
 I am telling all who read this if you hate shaving GET THIS PRODUCT you will love it.
