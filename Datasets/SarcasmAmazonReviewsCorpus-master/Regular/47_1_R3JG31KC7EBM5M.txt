<REVIEW>
Mine is utilized for robotics projects--it finds a lot of uses with metal.  I also bought the press accessory with it.  This little accessory helps me make straight cuts and drill holes. I'm telling you, I use this thing constantly and it works like a champ!  It is powerful enough for me to cut all my brass and aluminum with the precision of that of a doctor.  For as handy as this tool is--I'd pay twice as much to get one if need be.  I've had mine for 5 months too. One HUGE word of advice.  WEAR SAFETY GOGGLES!  I know this may sound lame, but it saved my @ss!!!  When cutting some tubing, my disk exploded at full RPM's and the shrapnel hit me in the goggles.  (Of course I had my fat head over top of it while I was cutting)  Just be careful.  The tool is A+, but the little thing could be dangerous if you slack on the safety.
