<REVIEW>
I have read about 5 books by Nora Roberts.  My favorite was Honest Illusions.  I tend to read historical romance.  A friend gave me my first Nora Roberts' book Born in Fire.  That series of three books held my  interest to try another book of Ms. Roberts.  Honest Illusions I could  keep; the others all went back.  Tucker and Caro were a good match, but my  favorite character was Cy.  I had a strong feeling who the killer was  during the pathology section in the book.  (Don't want to spoiler it for  others.)  The actual killer isn't revealed until about three pages before  the book ends; and I felt some people should have moved out-of-the-area (if  you catch my drift).  Hard for people to forget and forgive in a story  about serial killers.  Sorry all you Nora Roberts' fans.  I had better  stick to historicals.
