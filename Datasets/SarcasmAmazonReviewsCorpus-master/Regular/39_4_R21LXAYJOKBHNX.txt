<REVIEW>
This antenna worked better than expected for it's size and price.
 Roof top mounted.
 It's wide beam width allowed reception from DTV stations at 136 to 188 degrees with no problem at a distance of 10 to 50 miles with 6-7 of 8 signal strength bars on DTV broadcast. Also worked good on analog broadcast.
 It also worked very well on a nearby hi-band VHF channel 13.
 This is a directional antenna so any stations on the back side will not be received.
 This worked better than my old 8-bay channel master.
 It is made for outdoor use but because of it's small size it could be used indoors.
