<REVIEW>
The main characters in this film have the same names as the main characters in Nicholas Sparks' novel, but the resemblance ends there.  While the film might be entertaining to some, this reviewer found it to be annoying and uninspiring.  The Allie and Noah in the book were portrayed as sensitive, intelligent and thoughtful individuals.  The Allie and Noah in the film are just two more average, impulsive teenagers with no special or endearing qualities and not a lot of common sense.  The reference to the elderly Allie's illness as "senile dementia" is misleading and inaccurate.  This reviewer recommends reading the book or listening to the book-on-tape for an inspiring love story and a more realistic and sensitive portrayal of Alzheimer's Disease and it's impact on the well spouse.
