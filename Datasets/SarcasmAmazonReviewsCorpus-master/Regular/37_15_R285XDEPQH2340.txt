<REVIEW>
My guitar was beautiful. The laquer finish was flawless. The fret board and bridge are excellent quality and dark. The construction and seems were excellent. The neck and set-up were excellent for a guitar at this price. The tone is very distinctive. You may wish to upgrade the gig bag and strap. Use the new strap attacher that allows the strap to be attached and removed easily for storage in a case. Don't add a button at heel - unbalances guitar and you risk the finish.
 The instructional C.D. is fun and inspiring. Esteban really encourages you to aprreciate your instrument and the sound of it. As a bonus, Instructional C.D. 1 includes Esteban in concert - wow! And to top it off, besides the instructional C.D.s and chord chart it includes his Into the Heart C.D. - great for in the car or at home. Esteban is truly a master of the guitar. He teaches with the guitar you are purchasing so you hear how it sounds when tuned and played correctly! I'm ordering the rarer White burst. It is getting harder to find a Gift of Guitar package with the natural spruce top or the white burst - so grab one if you get a chance. At this price there isn't too much that compares for how much you get.
