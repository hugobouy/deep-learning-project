<PRODUCT>Dream On Me Full Size Play Yard, Navy (Baby Product)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
This is a very sturdy, attractive product that is just as nice as those much more expensive. And despite being sturdy, it's easy and light to move all over my condo. Rectangular shape is perfect for smaller spaces -- same square footage as square play yards, but the rectangle shape fits easily into more places (like bringing it into the dining room when the sit-down dinner went on too long for a one-year old; the square play yard would not have fit). I'm an urban grandma and did not want anything with primary colors. The navy looks very nice with my decor. I was worried about the lower price, thinking the play yard would be inferior.  Don't worry.  It's not.  Happily, this is not a case of "you get what you pay for."  I'm very pleased with this play yard, my granddaughter is happy in it.  Great play yard.
