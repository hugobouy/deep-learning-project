<REVIEW>
Simple Plan's second original CD, "Still Not Getting Any . . . " gives its legion of fans no letdown after the long wait for the second CD.  If anything, it is an improvement on the first.
 
   Fans at their shows have already been introduced to "Welcome to My Life" and "Shut Up!", both good, catchy songs just packed with the adolescent angst that is SP's trademark.  "Shut Up!" in particular, shows the band's knack for combining downbeat lyrics with upbeat tunes, in a song which I interpret as a teenager's thoughts while being lectured by his parents.
 
   Something's changed a bit from the first CD, and that's the band's perspective.  Many of the songs on "No Pads, No Helmets, . . . Just Balls" had the perspective of a teen complaining about a poor relationship with a parent.  There's still a bit of that in songs like "Me Against The World" and "Shut Up!", but this time, more songs talk about a romantic relationship gone bad (for example, "Perfect World", "Everytime" and "Thank You"), and the perspective is more young adult than teenager--"Everytime" talks about the partner waking the singer at 3 a.m. and driving to dawn--not likely if still living at home.  The band's characters are maturing, as is their music.
 
   Other notable songs include "Crazy", a throwback to Reset's (the predecessor band to Simple Plan) socially-conscious songs, and "Jump", plainly intended as a concert song but very strong in its own right.
 
   Perhaps the strongest song on the CD is "Untitled", a downbeat song with downbeat music, the dying thought of someone who doesn't know why he's dying, and despite the people around him, is dying utterly alone.  The sadness which runs through many of the band's works is here in full strength.  Softer than usual and using a piano (shades of "Meet You There" on the first CD), even if never released as a single, it may well be the band's best song to date.
 
   While lead singer Pierre Bouvier did almost all the singing on the first CD, much more is heard from backup singers Sebastien Lefebvre and David Derosiers do a lot more of the singing here, and they are well worth listening to.
 
   Extras on the DVD or flip side (depending on edition) include the video for "Welcome to My Life" and the program (shown, I believe, on MTV) about its making.
 
 Highly, highly recommended.
