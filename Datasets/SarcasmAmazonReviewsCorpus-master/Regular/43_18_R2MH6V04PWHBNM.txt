<PRODUCT>Philips Norelco 7310 Men's Shaving System (Health and Beauty)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
This shaver is the third Norelco model I've had in 15 years... and without question the best and closest shaving of all!  From the side grip ridges (surrounding the head) that give an additionally secure feel to the handling... to the wash-out feature that affords easiest clean-up the 7310 is topnotch at a reasonable price! Highly recommended!
