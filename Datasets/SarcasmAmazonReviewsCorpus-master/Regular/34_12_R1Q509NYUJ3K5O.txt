<REVIEW>
My son received this for his 2nd birthday a few weeks ago.  He loves to mow just like his dad and is always asking to go outside to use his very own lawnmower.  He even takes it with us on walks around the neighborhood. We have not had any problems with bubbles- you just have to push it continuously to get good bubbles.  You won't get any bubbles if you only walk a step or two then stop.  However, he loves it even when there are no bubbles- he just wants to mow.  I love it because it is sturdy and not at all annoying like some other (talking) mowers on the market.  I would absolutely recommend this toy!!
