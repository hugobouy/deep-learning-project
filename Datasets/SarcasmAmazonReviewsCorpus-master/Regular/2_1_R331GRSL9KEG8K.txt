<REVIEW>
I have a Dell Inspiron 1520.  My old battery only held about 30 minutes of charge so I decided it was time to get a new one.  I was wary about purchasing the battery from pyrus electronics since it was so cheap.  Nonetheless, the battery arrived on time and it works perfectly fine. When the battery is fully charged, I get about five to seven hours of power (depending on screen brightness, active programs, etc.).
 
 Also, my battery fit perfectly into the slot.  There was no force necessary as stated in a previous review.
