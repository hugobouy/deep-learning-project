<REVIEW>
I have read and own all of the Sookie books.  Last summer, my husband and I started watching season 2 in the states.  By the time that we returned to Germany, we knew that we would not rewatch season 2.  We were sick to death of Mary Ann.  We are not prudes, but just how many orgies do we have to watch.  We will watch the finale, next Friday, because we have been told that Mary ann will die, and I will be so glad.  Unless the story lines improve and move closer to the books, I will not waste my money on season 3.  I am having my doubts about owning season 2.  Just sign us as very disappointed viewers.
