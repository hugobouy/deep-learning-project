<REVIEW>
I've used this overgrip for years now, and I refuse to use any other overgrip. I realized that, after shelling out some real money for those dinky 3-packs at Sports Authority or Modell's, I stumbled across the 12-pack offered on Amazon and, well...I got it! 
 
 This isn't a real big deal, but I really like the way the individual grips are packaged. They are more folded than rolled, which prevents the overgrip from rolling up by itself after you've unraveled it. Again, NOT a big deal, but an added bonus IMO. 
 
 The texture of this grip is just tacky enough where it doesn't interfere with quick grip changes. It is, however, sticky enough to adequately stay in your hand without you having to worry about a slippery handle. 
 
 I don't remember if other colors are offered, but to me, WHITE is pretty classic on a tennis racket. Maybe it's because Federer uses it, and I love the guy, but regardless, buy this package of grips and be content!
