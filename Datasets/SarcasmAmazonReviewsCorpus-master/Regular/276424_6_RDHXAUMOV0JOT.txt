<REVIEW>
What can one say about a movie based on a computer game. Angelina pulls off the Lara Croft part way better than I thought possible.  I enjoyed her two British sidekicks who unfortunately mostly just stay in Croft Manor. You'll recognize Croft's butler from the British series 'Red Dwarf.'  Both he and Bryce do a stand-up job. The sets are all around the world, a bit like a Bond movie, which no doubt increased the production cost. My only complaint is the director or producer (or both) seemed to take the plot way too seriously, they should have had more fun with this. They did on occasion achieve this, such as the scene where Croft asks the Templar #2 guy, "Who sits here? I don't think you sit here."  Pretty cheeky, there should have been more humor like this. Not the Roger Moore/James Bond tongue in cheek, but something funny yet ironic.  The DVD version had tons of extra, all of which are watching.  I hv not seen the Blu Ray version but recommend the DVD version. A bit like Bond, but with popcorn plot, not that Bond plots could be taken any more seriously.
