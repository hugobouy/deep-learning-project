<PRODUCT>TomTom  XXL 540S 5-Inch Widescreen Portable GPS Navigator (Electronics)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
I have owned several GPS units, including models from Garmin and Navman. I upgraded to this model from the TomTom 140S. This model has twice the screen size. The screen is brighter, and the sound is louder and fuller. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Routing is excellent. The Points of Interest database is huge. Advanced lane guidance is very helpful. The large screen makes data input easier. Like all TomToms, you can configure it to your liking. 
 
 The only negative is that battery life is reduced because of the larger, brighter screen.
