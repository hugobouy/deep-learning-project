<REVIEW>
I bought this motherboard to build a descent mid-end system replacing a very old computer.  It was very easy to install and the manual was very well explained about the MB's parts.  Although I could not find the audio jumper configuration in the motherboard to choose between AC'97 and HD audio, I believe there was no need for it since the manual said HD audio was the default configuration and you would obviously prefer HD audio.  Overall, very good price for a very good motherboard.  Great for a mid-end system.
