<REVIEW>
Have been reading since age 4 (am now 68) and mostly fiction for the past 50 years.  A novel a week.  This trilogy is, in my opinion, the finest series I have ever read and Hornet's Nest may be the very best piece of fiction I have ever read.  I found myself purposely slowing down in my reading because I simply did not want it to end.  These are not stand alone books.  Read them as 1-2-3 and you will never forget the experience.  The biggest problem is what to read when you are finished.  Everything else pales by comparison by virtually every measure.  I envy those of you who have not started the journey or who are looking forward to the second and third novels. I almost look forward to the possibility of Alzheimers so I can read these over and over for the rest of my life. I may do so anyway.
