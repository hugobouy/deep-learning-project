<REVIEW>
I've only read a couple books by Jane Green and was not impressed but this book was unbelievably good!  Granted I am nearly 9 months pregnant and have a toddler of my own but this book had me bawling.  I was so invested in the characters and what happened to each that I almost couldn't finish the book out of fear of what would happen.  Steff is your typical chick lit, flighty character and you can pretty much predict what would happen to her in the end.  Still the story was written in such a way that it will keep you engaged and hoping for a happy ending for all of the main characters.  Callie's husband at first had me guessing if he was going to go the route of the busy working husband who would turn out to be a cheater or a loving husband that would be there no matter what.
 
 The other nice thing about this book was each chapter opens up with a recipe.  Some of them sounded so tasty I may just have to try them out myself.  Really there wasn't anything I actively disliked about this story.  The only slightly negative thing I can say is much of the story is predictable but I find that true of all chick lit books.  This is definitely a must read book but have a few tissues on hand.
