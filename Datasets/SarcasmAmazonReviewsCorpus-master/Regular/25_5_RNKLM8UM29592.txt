<PRODUCT>Morgan Design - 1 oz .999+ Fine Silver Bar</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
Received quick and in good condition. Reasonable price for low quantity orders. Obviously anyone can watch the price of silver and know if they're getting a good deal or not.
 
 I'll order again for my 1 or 2 qty bar or coin purchases.
