<REVIEW>
I just finished reading BIAS and I HIGHLY recommend it for people of all political persuasions.  A couple things to note: 1. It's a very engaging read -- well written and entertaining on top of infomative.   2. It's much more SUBSTANTIAL than I expected.  I thought it would just be an anti-liberal gossip session but it had a LOT of MEAT in it that I think would be interesting to any AMERICAN, not just a conservative one. 3. I've always sensed a liberal bias in the media, but thought that was just "spin" ...reporting the PART of the news that fit their agenda.  I was sincerely shocked to learn of instances where they have FLAT OUT LIED to us. Great Book!
