<REVIEW>
saw troll 2 on hbo back in 1992 or 1993.this movie is painfully boring.painful to watch.couldnt watch this with a migraine.people avoid this one.if u like a troll movie go with the first one.not the second.bad acting,bad scenes.too bad period.this is only for people who adore bad flicks.i just cannot do this one.also the opening credits music scared me half to death.i thought for a minute those goblins were right there beside me.this is a bad movie i dont care for.
