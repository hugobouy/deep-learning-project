<REVIEW>
I ordered this for my grandmother, she has trouble with her legs. I got it, put he batteries in, and it didn't work. I called the company and they sent me a return lable to mail it back. I told them I wanted a new one to see if I could get one that worked and filled out the slip to get a replacement. A few days later I got an email from amazon for a refund. I don't know if there was a misunderstanding or maybe there weren't anymore in stock. I decided to not try to reorder this product. If I had to rate just the customer service, I would have given higher then a 1..The guy on the phone was very understanding and fast at getting the return lable to me.
