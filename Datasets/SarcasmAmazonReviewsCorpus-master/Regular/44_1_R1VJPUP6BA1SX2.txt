<REVIEW>
As if riding a 1947 Vespa in olive-drab green weren't enough, I also wear this helmet.  My roommate was worried I'd get beaten up; I thought people would be amused.  I was right.
 
 It's a good-looking helmet and very well-made.  It's also fairly light weight considering how substantial it is.  A word of warning, however -- it is much thicker than what you might expect -- think Darth Vader-sized as opposed to trim barely-bigger-than-your-head like you see in the movies.
 
 I see that someone hasn't received what they ordered from Jafrum, and I feel bad for them.  I received it faster than I expected, actually, ready to go the moment it came out of the box.
