<REVIEW>
I have been very entertained with this book since I was a child. This book is a very interesting and good read with lots of great situations from everyday life to the extremes. 
 
 This book is great for emergencies but it's also good for everyday reading. It contains a lot of useful information gathered from other books in the series. Not only will you read about dangerous situations, but you will also be able to read about social situations such as meeting your date's parents. 
 
 The facts in this book seem very logical. It's not made up and misleading information. The author of this book/series has put a lot of research into situations mentioned in the book(s). This book and its information is not a hard to read book at all. The wording is very simple for you to be able to actually remember some of the steps for situations. Everybody from ages 6 to 150 years of age will enjoy and love this book.
 
 For $16 this book is a very good deal. If you look at the other series (there are a lot) and add up the cost for each one, they come out to a ridiculous amount. This book is a combination of all the books except the history edition. It doesn't have everything in it, but it has the BEST of the BEST worst case scenarios. The book is also very well designed. The yellow cover and simple titling really make it attractive. The hard cover also adds to the "wow" factor. It's a great book to show off to your friends/family.
 
 For $16, you get an exciting read, amazing information, attractive book, and maybe your life! I recommend this book to anyone! It makes a great gift.
