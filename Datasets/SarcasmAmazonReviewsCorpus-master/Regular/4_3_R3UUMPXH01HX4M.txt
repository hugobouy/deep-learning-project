<REVIEW>
I've loved everything Black Eyed Peas have done so far and haven't been disappointed with this CD.  So many times I will buy a CD and only found 1 or 2 tracks I like but there is not one song I don't like on this CD.  All the songs are fun, energetic and simply great to listen to. Buying this CD will be a great addition to your playlists.
