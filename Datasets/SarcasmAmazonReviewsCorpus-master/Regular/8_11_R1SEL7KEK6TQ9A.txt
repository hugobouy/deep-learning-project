<REVIEW>
This was a surprisingly well written book.  The author takes a fairly unbiased perspective on Rush addressing the good and the bad. I appreciate that Rush gave the author access to so many people in his life, including his psychiatrist! The book moves along quickly not dwelling too long on any one topic.
