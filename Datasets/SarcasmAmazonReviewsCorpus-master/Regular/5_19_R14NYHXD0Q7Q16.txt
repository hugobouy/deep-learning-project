<REVIEW>
I'm actually somewhat of a fan of Rufus' work. However, this is one he should have left alone. His voice and stage presence are clearly not meant for classic showtune-ish songs about adult themes which require range, vibrato, nuance, and gosh, you pick a few. His interpretation is flat and lacking in, well, interpretation. 
 
 He's handsome and talented, no doubt. He should stick to what he does best. 
 
 The second star is for the orchestra, though they should have had more sense as well.
