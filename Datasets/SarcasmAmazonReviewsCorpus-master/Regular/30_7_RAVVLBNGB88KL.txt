<REVIEW>
Just had this for lunch right now and it was delicious! Very tasteful and goes PERFECTLY over rice. Specifically the KOI Kashmiri Basmati rice! The portions are perfect as well when mixing the two. 
 
 It was very tasty and quite filling too. This is probably my current favorite KOI meal. I've tried the rajma masala, dal bukara, pindi chana, and palak paneer. My second favorite would have to be the pindi chana. The rajma is OK but I don't prefer the flavor as much. The palak paneer is a little bland but oddly spicy. And the dal bukara is quite salty.
