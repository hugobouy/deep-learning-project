<REVIEW>
I ordered this as a 2nd monitor to replace the 19" CRT I had been using with my sys. My primary display is an Acer AL2002W, and wanted to match it up and decided to go with this as I could not find one or one close to it. This monitor is pretty much a internet monitor for use while working.
 
 Pros: Great looking display. Text is tight and crips, blacks looks clean as do whites.
 
 Cons: Thought that the info said this was a 1680*1050 display but that was a reviewer comment, not Amazon. True aspect 16:9@1600*900 60Hz
 
 Other: For a good 2nd display, or even a Primay this is a good deal. Would have like a height adjustment, but as the AL2002W does not have this, was not expecting this one to either. For $120 I can't say anything bad about it other than what I noted under cons.
