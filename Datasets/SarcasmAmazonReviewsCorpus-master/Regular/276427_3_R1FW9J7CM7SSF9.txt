<REVIEW>
After much research, I purchased two PS3 Slim's for my HDTV's because they come with built-in Wi-Fi and a great Blu-Ray player, in addition to being an awesome gaming system.  Plus, the HDMI connections are easy and excellent quality.  I'm 62, and was looking for a box that would let me use the wide selection of Netflix instant download movies and programs.  I'm happy to report that the picture and sound quality of Netflix downloads is very good on the PS3.  Much faster and better than I expected.  Not hi-def, but better than regular TV.  And I have the Blu-Ray to watch movies by mail from Netflix at the highest quality.  Blu-Ray really is an awesome experience if you have a big HDTV and a surround sound system.  I use the Sony CT-500 sound bar and subwoofer that has amazing sound quality and separation.
 
 Sony markets the PS3 as an "entertainment system" and I agree that it serves this function very well for me.  I returned my hi-def cable boxes to Cox and am now saving $65 per month that was being wasted on crummy channels with endless commercials that I never watched.  Now I can get quality programming that I choose myself instantly on demand from Netflix without any commercials.  I can play, pause, and re-play a program as much as I like, just like playing a DVD.  Sony PS3 plus Netflix really is wonderful and cost-effective solution for users like me...
 
 Highly recommended!
