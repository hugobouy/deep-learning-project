<REVIEW>
"Anne of Avonlea" is a brilliant companion to the original "Anne of Green Gables."  This sequel combines the next THREE novels in the series --- "Anne of Avonlea," "Anne of the Island," and "Anne of Windy Poplars."  Several characters are combined to make ONE specific character, but the story still remains very much Anne's story.
 
 Now a little older, having taught at the public school in Avonlea for a while, Anne decides to try her hand at teaching at a private school in Kingsport --- a wealthy town mainly run by a particular set, the Pringles.  It's a new and daunting experience --- especially considering that she can't seem to win over the students or the school board --- but her stubbornnes won't allow her to give up, and she charges forward with her usual determination.
 
 There are several new characters, but we still have appearances by the old ones.  We meet Morgan Harris, his intelligent daughter Emmeline, his mother and his sister, and of course we meet countless girls who go to Kingsport Ladies College.  But Rachel Lynde and Marilla Cuthbert are still around, Diana Barry remains a wonderful friend, and of course there is the wonderful Gilbert Blythe --- more in love with Anne than ever.
 
 This is one of the best sequels I have ever seen, it fits perfectly with the original movie and does a decent job of remaining as faithful as possible to the books, in spite of everything that was altered.  I love this movie.  To this day, my family occasionally has "Anne Weekends," in which we watch "Anne of Green Gables" one night and "Anne of Avonlea" the next!
