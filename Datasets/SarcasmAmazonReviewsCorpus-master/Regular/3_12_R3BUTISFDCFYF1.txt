<REVIEW>
I just got my new Garmin 765T last night -- I live in a rural area of Oregon.  It immediately recognized the road I live on, so I was pleasantly surprised.  We drove 90 miles north to Eugene today and it only missed a fwy on-ramp that had been redesigned a couple of years back.  I haven't updated this yet, so in my mind, weather or not an update resolves this, I have NO complaints.  It gives plenty of warning when to turn.  The volume is perfect in my van -- I had to lower it actually, so not to be annoying.  The Bluetooth worked perfectly -- it is compatible with my T-Mobile Prepaid phone.  I used it to call home and I could hear very well via the Garmin speakers and was also heard by the person I was calling.  (The person who commented about not being able to listen to the Garmin thru the car radio FM speakers using a favorite station instead of a static source is a worthless feature... That's the way any FM transmitter device of this type works).  I am very glad I purchased this item.  Granted, I haven't used the MP3 player or the Audio Book features.  I will update at a later time once I've had more time with this GPS.  In the meantime, it did a great job today and I am very satisfied with everything about this item.
