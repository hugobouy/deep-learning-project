<PRODUCT>Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot (Paperback)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
I loved this book--I don't know when I've laughed so hard.  Maybe it helps that I'm a &quot;liberal&quot;--but what makes this a good book rather than just a book that says things I happen to agree with is that it's clever and well-executed.  The humor runs from silly to witty, but it's pretty consistently funny.   It's too bad the satire seems to be lost on some people.  The point of the book is that Franken is using the same methods that Rush Limbaugh &amp; co. use in a _satirical_ fashion in order to expose these methods as ridiculous.  Take his &quot;interview&quot; with Rush Limbaugh, modeled after the latter's &quot;interview&quot; with Hillary Clinton.  Yes, obviously it's quite easy to come up with the same sort of &quot;interview&quot; with Al Franken, but that doesn't do much to hurt his case.  The point of the Rush Limbaugh interview isn't so much to make Rush admit that he is indeed a big fat idiot by taking his words out of context as to make fun of the idea of such an interview as a cheap shot with which you can make anyone say anything.  So you can't really use Franken's methods against him to make him out to be a hypocrite, because the basis of the book is a humorous refutation of those very methods.  That's why it's funny.
