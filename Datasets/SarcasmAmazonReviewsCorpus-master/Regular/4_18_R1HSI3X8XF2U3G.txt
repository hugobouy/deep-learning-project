<REVIEW>
This movie was excellent. I had avoided it because I thought it was  as the critics said. I should have known. The cast was great and worked together well.  The premise seemed to have jumped from the airwaves of coasttocoast,  which I happen to enjoy, and the technology, well, unobtainium says it all. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, since the real raw material for it was funobtainium.
