<REVIEW>
I bought the 855 as an upgrade to my StreetPilot C550.  I was reluctant to buy it, based on the less-than-stellar reviews on here, but after using it for a week, I have no complaints at all.  Maybe that's due to the fact that I'm upgrading from the ancient 550, and not the 7X5 series.  The other reviewers are right, the on/off switch can be awkward, and you need a fingernail to push it over to the left.  But that is such a minor complaint, in my opinion.  Also, some people say they like the smoother refresh that the 7X5 series has, and this is more jerky, as you move along your route.  Well, you're not supposed to be watching it when you're driving anyway.  Oh, and it only has 500 waypoints, compared to 1000 on other models.  I'll be lucky if I use 100.
 
 What makes this GPS so remarkable is the voice recognition!  I feel like I'm using Star Trek technology.  It rarely has any problem understanding what I tell it.  Hands free GPS navigation!  I never have to pull over to type a new destination (or try to do it while driving).  I can't imagine any of the minor complaints offsetting the awesomeness of the voice recognition.  Now that it's available, I wouldn't have a GPS unit without it.  If your budget allows for a voice recognition GPS with 1000 waypoints, an improved on/off switch, and smoother screen refresh, then by all means get that one.  But if you're looking to spend about $300, and want voice recognition, do not hesitate to buy the 855.  I wouldn't exchange it for a non-voice recognition unit that has those features that this one lacks.
