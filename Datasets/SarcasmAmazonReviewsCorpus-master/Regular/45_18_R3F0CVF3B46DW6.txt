<REVIEW>
I was looking for the perfect bag to carry my books and laptop at college, and this is it!  It's got a ton of pockets including room for a 15.4" laptop that straps securely in a padded pocket.  Even with the laptop in the bag you can fit books and notebooks with no problem.  I also carry around my AC adapter and a car charger with no worries.  It's got a hard shell on the bottom of the bag to protect your computer from damage if it's dropped.  You couldn't ask for more!
