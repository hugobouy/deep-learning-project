<PRODUCT>Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
I was at the first show for TRIBECA and was just a few feet from Alex and Geddy who also spoke at the front of the theater....that was a great experience.   The movie was also well made with lots of old footage and great accolades from other rock bands (i.e. Metallica, KISS, etc.).      A must see for any Rush fan!
