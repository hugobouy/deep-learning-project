<REVIEW>
I have had a small double-chin problem that bothers me a lot, cosmetically. I have also suffered periodically from neck soreness. When I saw this little gizmo on TV, I was skeptical at first, but I decided to give it a try through Amazon, being nervous about the high pressure I might get from the direct TV phone number. I have used Neckline Slimmer now for five weeks, and I am amazed and happy with the results. First of all, I and others have noticed a clear difference in my double chin. This past week, at least three people asked me if I had lost weight, and the truth is, I've lost none, but my chinline is firmer! Moreover, a positive side effect that I did not expect is a very tangible strengthening of my neck muscles. This aspect is noteworthy and has helped me improve my posture and overall comfort.
 
 So, I have gained confidence and muscle tone. I plan on using this apparatus for the rest of my life, and will give it as gifts to others, especially those with neck problems. 
 
 My advice: use the Neck Slimmer as suggested. Don't overdo it or your neck might get sore. Do the full routine while sitting in the correct posture. Don't go too fast to the strongest coil; rather, use the coil that feels most comfortable, and work your way up. (I have not even started using the strongest coil yet, so my great results come from the middle strength coil.)
 
 My guess is that the poor results described in the other comments come either from expecting too much too fast, or by mis-using the apparatus. I for one am a very satisfied customer, especially considering the very moderate cost and the mimimal time needed each day to do the exercises. I recommend this highly!
