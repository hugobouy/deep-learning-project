<REVIEW>
My family loves our new RCA Drc629n dual screen dvd player. At first I thought that I would have to return them, because the installation straps are vertical and I really needed something horizontal since my Dodge Durango's headrest are all one solid piece. I decided to try to criscross the straps and it worked perfectly. My children can't wait to get in the car and watch the their movies it keeps them quiet on the way home and also long trips.  The clarity of picture on the screens are AWESOME. GREAT Price!!
