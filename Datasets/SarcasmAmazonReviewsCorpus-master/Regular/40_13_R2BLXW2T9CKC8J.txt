<REVIEW>
I'm happy with this bundle. I ordered it when I saw it, and it came quicker than expected. I told my husband his birthday present might be a day or two late and it arrived the day before his birthday.
 
 Setting up the system was easy and quick for him, and he was happy that the hdmi cable was included. He doesn't always trust me to order games or game systems for him.
 The game included wasn't to his tastes, but honestly? I don't recall a single time we ever got a bundle that included a game he was interested in. What made this bundle a winner for me was that it IS a game my teenage daughter was interested in. She's been having a blast with it. I told him what I was getting him for his birthday so if he wanted any particular game he could get it for himself. I also did order Final Fantasy XIII when it came up as a Gold Box deal recently. 
 He put on a movie to see the quality of movie playback on the machine and we were all very happy with that. 
 As a non-gamer looking for a good present for a husband who does like console games and for something my teens would like, this is a good deal. Everyone is very happy with it for movie playback, my daughter loves Little Big Planet and visually as a crafter, I love the look of Little Big Planet. Lots of great inspiration in the colors and shapes in the game.
 As far as stars go, I asked my husband and daughter. He rated the bundle as very good for the system and hdmi cable. When I asked my daughter about the game, she said it was one of her favorites that she ever played. "It's very fun!"
