<REVIEW>
I purchased these through the fullbar website a few weeks back.  One, to see if they worked, two if they tasted good and three if other's found them helpful as well.  What I found is for me they are tasty and filling.  I then gave a few of my overweight patients some to try.  They found them to be very helpful.  The very overweight patients lost on average 2lbs+/wk for the last 3 weeks.  Normal weighted people, like myself, haven't lost in pounds, but I feel firmer as do they.  I am a massage therapist, so I am pretty muscular, but I would like to stay healthy and maintain normal eating habits so this bar is great for me for just that reason, but it does seem to help with weight loss as well.  I have tried all the flavors of these bars and they are all pretty tasty...No,they aren't horrid or dry, but they aren't snickers bars either.  Just a fine, not overly done flavor that does fill you up prior to eating.  I ate before lunch and dinner.  Smoothie for breakfast.  
 
 Just in case you are wondering the average Nutrition Facts on all the bars are:
