<REVIEW>
I love the Jenny Cain series.  I have read all of them and each one gets  better as you go along.  The only bad thing that I can say is that it looks  as if Nancy Pickard is no longer writing books in this series.  I'm hoping  she will come out with a new Jenny Cain book.  I can't say enough about  these books.  The plots are great.  Please Nancy write more!!!!!
