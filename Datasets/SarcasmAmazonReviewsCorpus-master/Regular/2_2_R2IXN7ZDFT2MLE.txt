<REVIEW>
I have an external hard drive that is "air-cooled" but it is in a location where air circulation is somewhat blocked. This little fan takes care of that problem and keeps it running cool. I had tried battery-powered fans, but the batteries would die too quickly. If I'm not using the external HD, I just reposition the fan to provide extra circulation for the tower. 
 
 This fan is extremely quiet and works unobtrusively. I don't even hear it running.  Since I normally shut off my computer when I'm done, I'm not really bothered by the lack of an on-off switch.
 
 This fan is a great solution to one of life's annoying little problems. :-)
