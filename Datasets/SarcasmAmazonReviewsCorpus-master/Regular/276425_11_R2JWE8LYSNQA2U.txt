<PRODUCT>Boldtext Pew Bible: King James Version (Hardcover)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
Sturdy and quite heavy for its size, this no-frills Bible is an excellent value, and would make a very good second or third Bible. Well constructed with an imitation leather look on the cover, the font size is not large, but it is in bold print, and very readable and easy on the eyes.
 What it has: 
 A presentation page.
 "Daily Bible Readings," giving a table of three systems for reading the Bible in one year.
 A seven page history of the Bible, and how the King James Version came to be. First published in 1611, there were several subsequent revisions, and the version we read today is most like the 1769 revision.
 What it does not have that you would likely find in a better quality Bible:
 It has no cross-references, making it a poor Bible for study.
 The words of Jesus are not printed in red.
 It has no concordance.
 No maps.
 No ribbon marker.
 
 Many people use a modern language Bible for study, enabling greater clarity and understanding (and I recommend the New King James Version, or the one I have used for years, the Amplified Bible), but the King James Version is nevertheless glorious in its language, should be read at least once in a lifetime, and is invaluable for comparison of texts, and though I feel it is a sadly short-sighted view, some consider the King James Version as simply great "literature," comparing it to Shakespeare, and read it only for the beauty of its prose.
 Due to this edition not having cross-references, it does not make a good primary Bible, but will be more than adequate as a secondary translation, and the King James Bible is a version one should definitely own.
 
 Psalm 66:19
 King James Version: "But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer."
 New King James Version: "But certainly God has heard me; He has attended to the voice of my prayer."
 Amplified Bible: "But certainly God has heard me; He has given heed to the voice of my prayer."
