<REVIEW>
New Moon starts out wonderfully - Edward's family throws Bella a birthday party, but when she has an accident and starts bleeding, the whole vampire household flips out. Consequently, Edward is filled with guilt and decides that she needs to lead a normal life without being endangered by their presence every day, and so they all pack up and leave. I nearly choked when I saw that time passes without him.
 
 But, try as she might, Bella is empty without him. She realizes that when she is in danger, she can hear his voice in her head (usually yelling), and so she begins to pursue dangerous hobbies just to hear his voice again. One of these hobbies brings her into close friendship with Jacob Black, the Quileute Indian boy who tipped her off to Edward's identity in the first book, and he seems to temporarily appease her pain at Edward's absence. But Jacob has his own secrets, and Bella is again endangered when a vampire returns to Forks for revenge.
 
 I must admit, most of the reason this book kept me up late reading was in hopes of word from Edward. Jacob and his friends were fun, and it *was* exciting to see another facet of the books' mythology, but almost the whole time Bella was with Jake, I was adamantly pining for Edward. When he does return, I was not disappointed, and Jake's involvement also sets up the potential for a powerful love triangle.
 
 It wasn't quite as solid as the first book, but I sense that New Moon is an important transition. Many questions were brought up, like whether vampires have souls, and just how far must Bella and Edward go to stay together? She wants to become one of them, and Edward insists that she remain human. Now that we've caught wind of it, what exactly is agreed in the treaty the vampires have with the Quileutes? And what will Bella do now that her boyfriend and her best friend are mortal enemies? All of this feels like necessary groundwork in order to address these issues in the next book. I enjoyed New Moon immensely, despite Edward's absence for most of it, and I'm eager for the next installment; I can't wait to see how Meyer resolves some of these issues, and what ride we will experience in the next book.
