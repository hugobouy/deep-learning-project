<REVIEW>
After I saw Thin Red Line on opening day, I was so disappointed with the lousy directing and character acting, I decided to never again see any movie hyped and directed by an unknown director. This was commercially  hyped to attract the Saving Private Ryan market, then thinly (and poorly)  attempted to appear deep, mysterious and profound. It missed the mark on  all accounts. This is just a waste of time. Failure, big time!
