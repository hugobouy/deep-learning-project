<PRODUCT>Factory-Reconditioned Bostitch U/CPACK1850BN 18-Gauge Brad Nailer and  Compressor Combo Kit (Tools & Hardware)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
Just opened up the box and I was impressed. The nailer and compressor both look like new. Plugged the thing in and slid in a sleeve of nails and started looking for something to test the nailer. Works awesome although my workbench now has a row of brads in it. I'll give the compressor a workout next weekend when I shingle my folks roof. Looking forward to it already.
