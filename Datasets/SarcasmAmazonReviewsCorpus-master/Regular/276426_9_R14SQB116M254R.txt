<REVIEW>
We bought this TV to replace a 27" flat screen (tubed) TV. Easy set-up out of the box, factory settings were just about dead on. We're not huge tech heads so it pretty much has everything we were looking for. One thing to note is that if you're new to LCD's there's a little adjustment to be made. The refresh rate on  this is 60hz, the higher end ones are 120hz, I believe plasmas are in the 700hz range. You'll notice little things if you're up close, like white caps on waves get a little pixelated. Also your old shows like Sienfeld look really lousy up close. After a few months I don't notice any of this anymore and we're very happy with the TV. We just bought a Sylvania 22" for the bedroom. 
 Bottom line, for the average TV viewer, great picture and sound, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one. Also, great customer service when I had trouble hooking my computer up through the HDMI port, changed the PC resolution and all was good.
