<REVIEW>
We got this as a gift a few years ago and have not used it to often and usually for about four waffles each time we used it. So I think that is why it worked for as long as it did. We had the fuse burn out on us this weekend. I looked at other reviews and took the maker apart to maybe fix it on my own. Once I looked inside and found the fuse I didn't feel comfortable that my fix would be protected from the heat so I decided to trash it.  We are going to look for one that takes up less space and will last 10 or so years, which I think these should. Frustrating though, I think it would be an easy design update to make the fuse a pop in and out type. That would be easy to change out and make this last the time it should.
