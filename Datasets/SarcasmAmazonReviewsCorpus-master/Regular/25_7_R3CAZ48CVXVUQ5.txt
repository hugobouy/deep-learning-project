<REVIEW>
I ordered this little beauty after killing my classic Doc Johnson...hehe.  This one is definitely better than any other battery-operated vibrator I have owned.  The unique shape makes getting those harder to reach "areas" much easier than using a traditional straight vibrator.  The vibrator is soft and flexible and the motor is located at the uniquely-shaped head.  One caveat: be sure to have plenty of AA batteries on hand because it does tend to drain them quickly!  Overall, a great vibrator to have in your arsenal!
