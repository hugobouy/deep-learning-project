<REVIEW>
I upgraded my bedroom tv to this Samsung HDTV.  The picture and quality of a Samsung HDTV is outstanding.  I had another brand of HDTV in there first, but with the new HD Receiver I purchased, I couldn't get a picture on it.  I moved it to another room and with the Samsung I had no problem at all.  I now have 3 Samsung LCD HDTV sets in my house, Living Room 52", bedroom 32" and 23" in dressing room.  I couldn't be happier with my purchases of Samsung HDTV TV Sets.
 
 I have had several people tell me that they have never seen a better picture on a HDTV than the ones I have.
