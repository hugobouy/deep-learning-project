<REVIEW>
This was so well done.  I started it in the evening and it was very late when I finished as I wasn't going to bed until it was done.  It's a bit of a romance, a bit of a gothic, but mainly a mystery of family secrets.  The story is meticulously plotted with all of my "but what about" questions answers and threads tied.  Pickard makes the reader feel as though they are a resident of this small Midwestern town and her use of the weather to create atmosphere and suspense is very well done.  The story stayed with me long after finishing the book and that, to me, is one sign of an excellent book.
