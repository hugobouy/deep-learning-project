<REVIEW>
The Criterion Collection release of Armageddon is a treat.  It offers 2 commentary tracks, one featuring the director Michael Bay, actors Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck.  Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has comments on several interesting things.  Affleck's commentary is sometimes very funny.  The other commentary track features the Director of Photography and special effects people. The commentary includes interesting details, including background information on the characters and filming locations.  Note:  The commentary is raw and sometimes laced with profanity, although the movie itself is rated PG-13, for reasons explained in the commentary.   Although it's not much, this collection is also a Director's Cut and has a couple scenes added, notable of which is Harry Stamper's character visiting his father before launch.  Some other scenes are cut slightly differently, adding some depth to the story. The Gag reel on the second disk is extremely funny, raw, and not your typical &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; documentary. The second disk also features a tremendous amount of information on the special effects and includes many different trailers and promo material.  The Aerosmith song video is also included. While the story can be nit-picked, it's still very exciting and enjoyable.  Overall, if you liked the movie, the Criterion Collection release is the DVD to have.
