<REVIEW>
I can't believe its over :( Im not going to go into specifics of my interpretation of the show or why I liked or disliked the ending..I could ramble on all day about that, but for those who complain about all the answers not being revealed, I think we forget why we loved this show in the first place. So many of us stuck with this show for 6 years from day one, and will always hold a special place in our hearts ... It would have been impossible to end something like that with everyone satisfied. It may be "over" but I know at least for me, I'll be thinking about this show for a lifetime.
