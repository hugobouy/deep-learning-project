<REVIEW>
Avatar is a watershed moment in cinematographic history. It is a step forward as important as the first Star Wars movie was. Avatar is an experience not to be missed by any fan of movies, it is a truly impressive achievement.  I've been a movie fan since the late 1940's, in all that time I had never gone to any movie more than once while it was in it's first run... until Avatar. My wife and I have been to see Avatar three times in theaters (once in each of the three formats: Big screen 3D; IMAX 3D, and big screen 2D. We were favorably impressed by the movie, and the technology, in all three formats. We both felt that Avatar will be remembered as a powerful, ground breaking film, and that it will become a major classic.
  
 We recently bought the DVD and Blu-Ray two disc combination package (from Amazon.com) and consider the package to be one of the best bargains in entertainment. Getting two and a half hours of entertainment, in two high quality formats, each for the average price of one movie theater ticket is extraordinary... especially when the film is just concluding it's first run in theaters. 
 If you can see Avatar on a big screen (in 3D or 2D) by all means do so. I also recommend buying a copy to view at home... the quality and the experience on a good digital TV screen are extraordinary. This film is one that will influence the making of, and course of,  film entertainment for a long time to come.
