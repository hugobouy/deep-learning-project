<REVIEW>
I actually bought this book to give to my brother as a joke, and decided to read through it first.  I found it to be a very interesting account of  the abduction phenomenon.  While I don't believe that people are actually  being abducted by spacemen in flying saucers (a view the author seems to  share, incidently), I now believe this phenomenon is very real, and  probably very puzzling and frightening to the people who experience it.   For those people, this book should be an invaluable aid to help them take  control of their situation.  Recommended for anyone interested in the  subject.
