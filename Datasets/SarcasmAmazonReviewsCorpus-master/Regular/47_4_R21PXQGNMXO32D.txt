<PRODUCT>Motorola Motofone F3 Unlocked Phone with Dual-Band GSM 850/1900--International Version with No Warranty (Black) (Wireless Phone Accessory)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
This phone is hard-to-find-common-sense approach in design and technology. I have never seen better phone.  This is not a gadget that makes your life miserable because you need to worry every day that batteries are charged or you need to spend 1/2 day on setup or figuring out why current  time does not show on screen. If you need features behind phone, get Apple iPhone if you need just a cell phone, get Motorola F3.
