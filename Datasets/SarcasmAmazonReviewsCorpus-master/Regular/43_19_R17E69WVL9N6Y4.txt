<REVIEW>
This was the third monitor I bought for our second child.  Don't waste your time trying the least expensive ones like I did, this one is worth the money.  I have the Super Clear Double Receiver by Safety 1st in my 2 year old's room, which works perfect.  I needed a second one for my newborn.  I tried another Safety 1st, and even with 2 channels, I could only pick up sound from one room.  Then I returned it for a Sound N Lights monitor by Fisher-Price.  Bigger mistake, we couldn't hear any room, only major static.  Finally we tried this one and love it!!!  It is so quiet, except, of course, when your baby makes noise.  I can't believe how many channel options it has, and other features too, like an alarm when you are almost out of range.  Also, a rechargable battery, that charges when plugged in, so you don't have to waste your own batteries when wanting to use it outside.  Go for the Gold, this Sony is the best yet.
