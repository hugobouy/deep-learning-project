<PRODUCT>Sanus Systems Wms5-B Wall Or Ceiling Speaker Mounts (Black, 5-Pk) (Electronics)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
Good price, service and very fast shipping. Not really happy with this product cause it states that it can handle up to 8 lbs and in reality, it can't. I have 7 lb speakers that have stressed them to the point of almost failure (when mounting on the wall). After changing the mounting position from the side wall to the ceiling they are handling it much better. These mounts are only good for small speakers (like Bose) when wall mounting. If you are going to use them for heavy (capacity maxed) speakers, you should hang them from the ceiling.
