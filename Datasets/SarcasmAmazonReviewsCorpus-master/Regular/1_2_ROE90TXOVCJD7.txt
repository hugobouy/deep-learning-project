<PRODUCT>Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap - Great for Eczema, Psoriasis or Acne! (Health and Beauty)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
This soap works very well for my husbands Psoriasis, it's made with real mud from the dead sea in Israel and it really does work. It doesn't have any real scent to it and foams nicely.
