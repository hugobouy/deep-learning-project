<PRODUCT>Stop Snoring Mouth Piece - Anti Snore Device Sleep Apnea Cessation Aid (Health and Beauty)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
This product has dramatically improved my quality of life.  It works exactly as described.  I did find it difficult to fit at first, but eventually succeeded after 3 tries:  the effort was worth it.  My wife and I began to sleep apart when my snoring became excessive.  I have Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), and like many others have tried and failed to use a CPAP machine.  While the vendor cannot legally claim to be selling a cure for OSA, I have found it to be a cheap and effective substitute for the CPAP.  I not only do not snore when I wear the mouthpiece, but I sleep more soundly as well.  I now wear it even while away on business trips because of the improvement in the quality of my sleep.  For those who have tried CPAP and can't tolerate it, I highly recommend trying this product.
