<REVIEW>
It is the ingongruity of of a realistic looking pickle and the strong yodelling voice that comes out when you press the button that makes this toy so funny.  When someone in the family deserves a thumbs-up, we often reward them with a yodel from the pickle.  Good to have some silliness in the house.
