<REVIEW>
Filled with many well produced exaggerations designed to make a point and not necessary the truth of the situation.  While healthcare needs reform in the US, pointing to healthcare systems in other countries where their citizens come to the US for care if they can afford the cost is ridiculous.  Anyone that's followed Michael Moore's work has learned to expect a certain amount of exaggeration in his films, but Sicko sets a new high bar for him.  Net-Net: entertaining fiction presented as truth.
