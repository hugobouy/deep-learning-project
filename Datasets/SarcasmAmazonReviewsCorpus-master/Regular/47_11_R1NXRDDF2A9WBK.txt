<PRODUCT>MiVizu Black iPhone 4G Skin Case for iPhone 4 / 4th Generation compatible with 16GB / 32GB + Screen Protector and MiniSuit LCD Cleaner keychain</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
I order this product after pre-ordering my iPhone 4 on June 15th.  It was the only case I could find that seems to readily availble to ship from the merchant.  Received the item promptly just a few days before the phone arrived.  It included a front screen protector and a cleaning cloth.  
 
 The fit is pretty accurate and serves the purpose for protecting the sides and back of the phone considering it was likely manufactuered with limited specs available for the iPhone 4.
 
 My only complaint is with the finish - there is a raised seam all the way around the sides (and over the round volume buttons) where it's aparent the two halves the of the case were fused together or the injection mold wasn't cut properly. And the edges of the open cutouts for the headphone, mute button, dock connector, etc has a similar yet smaller lip around the openings.
 
 A minor complaint with the screen protector that it has that "rainbow" or oily look to it when held at an angle to the room light when the phone is off or on standby.  But viewing the phone directly you can't see it.
 
 But for my needs - having a case and screen protector available for the day I got my phone for a inexpensive price - this case meets my needs.  I plan to replace it in the future as other product become available and use this case as a back up.
 
 (Pictures of the seams coming soon)
