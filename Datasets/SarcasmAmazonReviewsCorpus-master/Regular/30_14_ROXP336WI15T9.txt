<REVIEW>
Given the rave reviews, I had expected a bit more out of this product. My carpet is light gray, so just about everything shows. It does clean up most spots with a varying degree of repeated applications, but there are those that it just doesn't have much of an effect on.  (My cats have a tendency to cough up some hairballs that come with food stains--salmon is especially tenacious.  One of them somehow manages to get the hairball-prevention goop from her paw onto the carpet in small amounts.  Surprisingly, the cleaner does quite well in getting those up when they do not respond to the Oxy Deep spray method.) I do like that I can clean smaller high traffic areas, such as the transition areas from the carpet to the tiled rooms (kitchen, bathroom) to help keep them fresh.  I have purchased a different cleaning solution, supposedly of a higher cleaning ability, so perhaps that will remedy those spots that are less responsive to the sample that came with the unit.
 
 It's easy to use and clean and fairly portable.
