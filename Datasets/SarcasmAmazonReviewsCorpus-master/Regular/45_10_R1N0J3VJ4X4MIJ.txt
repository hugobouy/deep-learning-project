<REVIEW>
After getting divorced at age 40, Nina Askew moves into an apartment and plans to get a puppy to keep her company.  Instead she ends up with Fred, a smelly and depressed beagle/bassett hound cross.  Fred is instrumental in her meeting her downstairs neighbor, the ER doctor Alex.  They are meant to be together, but Alex and Nina both think the other party won't be interested because of the age difference - Alex is ten years younger than Nina.  The characters are likeable, especially Fred, but the book was rather predictable.  At the end there are some easily-resolved misunderstandings thrown in that seem to be there just to make the book reach the 200-page mark.
