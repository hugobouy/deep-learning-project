<REVIEW>
Delivered in a timely manner and as advertised. This is a nice TV. Took it out of the box and hooked it up with no problems. Picture quality does depend on the quality of the input signal, think about it. I have it hooked up to a good cable signal and the picture is great. Nice selection of inputs. Only complaint is the speaker volume. In a quiet room there wouldn't be a problem. I watch it while riding my Airdyne exercise bike and it needs the aux. speakers I hooked up to it so I can hear it above the ambient noise. Still was a good buy.
