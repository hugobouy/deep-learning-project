<REVIEW>
Using an HDMI to DVI cable for video, and an RCA jack to stereo 1/8th inch jack for sound, this monitor plus my Time Warner HD cable box is now serving as a low cost 22" HDTV. While it would be nice to be able to change the sound volume using a remote (and I imagine I could if I ran the sound out from the set-top box through a stereo system or home theatre system), this is a perfectly acceptable solution for the competitively low price.
 
 Kudos to Amazon for getting this to me well ahead of schedule. Everything arrived well packaged and in excellent condition.
 
 The ViewSonic box included power cord, installation CD (for computer, not needed for my use), a VGA cable and brief instructions.
