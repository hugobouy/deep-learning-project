<REVIEW>
I did lots of research and comparisons before selecting the ASUS VW246H. Was very worried about getting bad pixels. I chose Amazon who has the best policy. Boy was the choice great!  This monitor has no bad pixels and was perfect straight out of the box.  Can't say anything at all critical about it.  Huge!   Awesome color, clarity, contrast and detail.  Can't go wrong with this monitor or with Amazon. Free shipping to sweeten the deal.
