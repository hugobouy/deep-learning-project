<REVIEW>
First off, I researched for days before buying this Shark Mop.  Many of the reviews slammed it due to lack of pivoting head, small tank and flimsy handle.
 
 Well, the NEW model has NONE of these issues!  The head pivots, the water tank is much larger (I cleaned my medium sized kitchen and entryway floor and still have almost a full thing of water) and it feels pretty sturdy - not flimsy.  The handle is also adjustable in height to make it easier.
 
 Now to how it performed.  Let me start by saying house cleaning week saw me with 2 or more different mops!  I have laminated wood flooring, hardwood flooring and kitchen tile.  The Swiffer Wet Jet I bought left streaks on my laminate, was afraid to use it on the hardwood and since my kitchen tile is bumpy and uneven it left puddles and some areas would not even get touched by Wet Jet pad.  So, I would clean my laminate with windex on my knees, my hardwood with hardwood cleaner and mop and my kitchen with a rope mop w/ammonia and water (ONLY thing that would pick up the grime this horrible floor attracts).  Having been diagnosed with a spinal disease, I would be hurting and exhausted from the bending, lifting bucket of water and mopping action.  I finally got fed up and went to Bed, Bath and Beyond to try the Shark Mop - bad reviews and all.
 
 I have NEVER mopped so many floors so fast, had them ALL looking great AND not be hurting or exhausted.  I can actually say mopping if FUN with this!  Now remodeling the second bathroom, it will have a different type of laminate - i'm so glad I will NOT have to have a 4th mop or system to clean it too.  The grime on the horrible, bumpy white tile in the kitchen?  It is so clean and streak free I'm keep looking at it with the thought of "wow" going through my head.  It NEVER looked this good and ALWAYS had streaks unless I squirted some Jet Dry in the mop water.
 
 In addition, after cleaning the kitchen floor, while preparing dinner, I had dropped the spatula with butter and egg on the floor. Then the youngest child decided to walk through the garage with bare wet feet and then onto my clean white tile floor.  30 seconds of heat up and less than 60 seconds later, floor was clean again.  SO EASY.  I will NEVER go back to regular mopping ever again.  I can't wait to try it in the travel trailer (I do that linoleum on my hands and knees after trips).
 
 You won't be disappointed in the new one - spend the extra $$$ to get larger tank, pivoting head, extra mop head attachments and steam duster!
