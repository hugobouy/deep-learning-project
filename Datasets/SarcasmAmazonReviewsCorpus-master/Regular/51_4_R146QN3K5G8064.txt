<REVIEW>
At first, people think this is some kinda sex-toy from the future. It's not. It's a beard trimmer. And a pretty good one to boot. If you're like me, you use your beard trimmer when you don't have much time in the morning before you have to take off for work. If you trim with this thing quickly on the 'normal' trimming mode, it'll catch maybe 75% of your hair in the vaccuum. However, when you enter warp speed (turbo mode) this thing is insane. It's really loud and sounds like it might explode, but it works great. It catches roughly 90-95% of hair in the vacuum in turbo mode. It's quite easy to take apart to empty out the little hair-catch-all and clean trimmer attachments or swapping them out (comes with a fine-line trimmer). The height adjustment doesn't seem quite as pronounced as my older Norelco trimmer (meaning you can obviously tell when it clicks into place...this one not so much) but it works nonetheless. I'm happy with it and recommend it to all who read this. Just be sure to take a minute out of your abnormally busy day to read the instructions and precautions and maintenance tips to prolong the life of this thing. That's what they're there for, after all.
