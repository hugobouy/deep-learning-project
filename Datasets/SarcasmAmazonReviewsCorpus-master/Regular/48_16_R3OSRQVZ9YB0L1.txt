<REVIEW>
Lucy began as her father's experiment.  He raised her in the jungle while giving her a strong British education.  She was also raised by her mother who gave her an introduction to life as a bonobo.  The rest of the story is about what happens after her parents are killed and she is rescued and taken to the U.S. by Jenny.  
 
 First of all you must suspend reality to enjoy this book.  Most people seem willing to do that, with the popularity of vampire stories and Harry Potter.  
 
 Clearly I loved this book.  It is a good story, well written and just plain fun.  From the beginning I knew everything was not going to turn out okay so I prepared myself for tragedy but it came in a different way than I expected.  The way Jenny learns to love Lucy and becomes a mother to her is lovely to read.  Lucy's friendship with Amanda gives me hope that there are good people out there who really care about something other than themselves.  The same can be said for the Randalls who rescue the damsels in distress more than once.  
 
 I liked the sense of place wherever the story takes us.  I so enjoyed seeing the world through Lucy's eyes as she tries to become an American teenager.  
 
 This book should be popular with teens and adults alike.  It is light reading and goes fast.  I was sorry when it was over, as I wanted to know much more.  I hope it gets made into a movie.  I am so sick of vampire movies, I think this would be far more heartfelt.
