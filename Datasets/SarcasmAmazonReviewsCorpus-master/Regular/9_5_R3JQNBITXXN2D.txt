<REVIEW>
The Scent of Rain and Lightning by Nancy Pickard was the best novel I've read in a long time. The first couple of pages grabbed me--there was no reading half the book before I decided I liked it.  Pickard writes in an easy style about people and life in Kansas, but it could be any rural/ranching setting.  The characters were described so perfectly that I felt like I grew up with them.  This is a murder mystery, but it's definitely not your typical who-done-it.  The plot unfolds gently--no harsh, sharp twists and turns.  It's also a love story and a story of a close-knit family.  It has everything but nothing is contrived; it's all very natural and believable.  I think the best way to describe the book is that it's a gentle, easy story about some ungentle events. I can understand why Pickard has received so many awards. She is a great American author; in my opinion on the same level as Twain and Steinbeck. This book is a MUST READ.
