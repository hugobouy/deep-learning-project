<REVIEW>
I was apprehensive when I read all the reviews about U3.  I simply wanted a reliable storage device and nothing else.  As soon as I connected the usb drive, I removed the U3 launchpad and technology.  It took a total of 1 minute and it was done.  No more U3 and I have an excellent 4 GB drive for 23 bucks.  Same drive sells at retail for over 40.  I run windows xp and it was no problem at all to remove the U3.  I can see how it may look overwhelming with all the programs/apps, but one or two clicks of a button and it was gone.  I highly recommend this drive to anyone looking for a place to store music, docs, pictures, etc....
