<REVIEW>
If you've ever seen this thing in action on the dry lake bed at Burning Man, you'd know that it's cool.  It's not a tank for battle for god's sake, it's a fun toy to drive on flat surfaces, amuse onlookers and inspire conversation.  I can't think of any use for it other than Burning Man, actually.
