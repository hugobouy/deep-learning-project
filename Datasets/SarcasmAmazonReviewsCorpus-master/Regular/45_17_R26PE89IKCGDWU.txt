<REVIEW>
This edition is an improvement over the theatrical release and is closer to the book.  My only disappointment related to this edition was that I opened the package to find a coupon for the ULTIMATE edition, which is to be released Decemberish.  The next (and I hope final) version will have the Black Freighter story woven into the main story as it is in the book.  If you don't want multiple versions of this film, hold off buying until the end of the year.
 
 I agree with the other reviewers who note the film's ending is an improvement over the book's.  It just makes more sense in the context of the story.  This is not a knock on Mr. Moore, of whom I am a big fan. 
 
 I don't understand the folks who are so down on this film, unless it is that they just had the wrong expectations and/or didn't do their homework before watching it.  It was never meant to be another Spiderman, Superman or Hulk story.
 
 Kudos to Mr. Moore.  Kudos for the team who produced this film.
