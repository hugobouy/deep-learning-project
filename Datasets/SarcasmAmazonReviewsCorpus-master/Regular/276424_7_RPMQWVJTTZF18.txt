<REVIEW>
For any American citizen who is currently in resignation or despair over the abundant examples of unethical, immoral and abusive leaders who breed cynicism and apathy,  The Audacity of Hope is a breath of much needed oxygen. Senator Obama may be considered "soft" by the media who enjoy taking down anyone who exhibits complexity of mind, paradoxical thinking and humanistic values, yet his writing inspires one to stop wallowing in helplessness and take an active role in our imperfect democracy.  When Obama first spoke at the Democratic convention, Ann Deavere Smith wrote an op ed piece the next day saying that politics would never be the same because finally a leader spoke with a "unifying fusion" beyond partisanship, stereotypes and blame mongering.  The senator's writing demonstrates that reflective, thoughtful consideration of apparent opposites is a leadership attribute needed urgently -- Obama speaks of the need to redefine power from its corrupt, controlling misuse as currently witnessed daily to an inclusive power that practices empathy, tolerance, and a reclaiming of core democratic values.  Obama leaves the reader with a call to face our critical global issues by polishing the lens of our own perceptions rather than projecting and perpetuating fear and hatred.  Whether he will be able to pass great legislation or run for president,  this book provides inspiration to any leader who wants to demonstrate a capacity to connect with the hearts, minds and souls of generations seeking to be inspired and uplifted.  He embodies the true sense of enlightened -"awake" not perfect--able to use his intelligence for the greater good while demonstrating the humility of one who knows his own shadows.  A highly recommended read for all would be leaders.
