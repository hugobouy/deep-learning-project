<REVIEW>
I purchased the ViewSonic VX2433WM from a warehouse retailer for an extraordinarily low price, which made it irresistable! 
 
 This monitor has vivid, crisp colors and is excellent at displaying graphics and video! By default, it is exceptionally bright, so I adjusted both the contrast and brightness to about 50%. This is a very responsive monitor with no ghosting present. It also came with zero stuck or defective pixels, which made me very happy. 
 
 The one area where this monitor could be improved is related to text display. At times, text can be a bit fuzzy on screen, but this is something I've noticed on other 24 inch displays before (notably Samsung). It's not a show-stopper, but text is not as clear as on my 19" monitor at home or at work.
 
 The built-in speakers are awful, with a really cheap sound. Fortunately, I don't plan to use them much. I think it has to do with function following form where, for beauty's sake, the speakers are on the back and downside of the monitor, creating an indirect sound. The sound is much worse than on my old 19" ViewSonic monitor.
