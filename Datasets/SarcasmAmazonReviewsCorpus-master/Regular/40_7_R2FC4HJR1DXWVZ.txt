<PRODUCT>Leatherman 934870 40 Bit Assortment with Nylon Sheath (Tools & Hardware)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
At first I was disappointed to see the new style.  I can see the locking mechanism weaaring out and bits just falling out of the Leatherman.  Leatherman's never let me down in the past, let's hope they keep their good reputation with this new design.  The usefulness of this bit set goes almost without question.  I carry it with me all the time and it's proven itself on several occassions.  
 
 If you want to fix almost anything almost anywhere, this bit set is good to have.
