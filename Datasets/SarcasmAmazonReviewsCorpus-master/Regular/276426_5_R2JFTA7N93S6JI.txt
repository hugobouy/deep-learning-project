<REVIEW>
I have to say that this entire series is one of my fvorites. Stephanie Myer bring an entire new angle to classic vampires love stories. She sheds new light and changes around old myths to make this an entirely new experience. I adore vampire stories of all kinds but these frankly are my favorite ever. You feel like you know the characters personally. While I do have the entire series of books I am greatly concidering buying the boxed set so I can have them all in hardound editions.
