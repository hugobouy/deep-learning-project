<REVIEW>
To echo what others have said this book is hilarious.  It's also sweet and touching.  Justin's dad is a gruff Vietnam vet, retired research doctor who is honest to a fault.  He's someone who knows himself and has the courage and a burning need to speak his mind.  He also loves his family to distraction.  Justin's dad is Jewish and his mom a quiet, loving Catholic and though their child rearing approaches seem as different as their religions they make a good parenting team.  
 
 Here are a few quotes which are NOT the funniest in the book but one's that are relatively lacking in four letter words:
 
 On Getting an Internship at Quentin Tarantino's Production Company:
 
 "That is one ugly son of a `gun'.....Oh, yeah, no congratulations.  If you see him, try not to stare at his face if you've eaten anything."
 
 After Justin moves out"
 
 "You just barge in and take whatever you want, whenever you want it.  It's like you're the ********* SS I'm living in ******* Nazi Germany...."
 
 At the End of the Day, at Least You a Have a Family:
 
 "So, there you go.  Your mother thinks you're handsome.  This should be an exciting day for you."
 
 On a hypothesized life of crime:
 
 "You always got us.  We're family.  We ain't going anywhere.  Unless you go on a ******* killing spree or something."
 
 "I would still love you Justy.  I would just want to know why you did it," my mom said earnestly.
 
 All these quotes can seem a bit over the top when you read them out of context but they never come across as glib or hate filled.....just honest.  Justin was the youngest of three sons and the last chapter of the book is the story of one of Justin's love affairs gone awry and his dad comforting by telling the story of his first wife's life and death.  The best thing about this book, besides the humor of course, is the emotional honestly.
