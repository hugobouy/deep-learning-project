<REVIEW>
The lipstick is very intense in color. So choose a color that is a little lighter than you would normally wear. It takes some time to learn how to apply the lip color.
  1. put on a single light coat quickly 
  2. let dry for one or two minutes
  3. Do not rub your lip together until you apply the clear balm.
  4. to remove use simple chapstick or Vaseline 
 Tip: You can use maybelline's Shine Seduction Lip Gloss on top of the superstay if you want the look of a lip-gloss but with more staying power.
