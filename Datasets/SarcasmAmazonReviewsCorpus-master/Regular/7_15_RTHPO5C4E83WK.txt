<REVIEW>
I, too, did the research. I read the glowing reviews on this site and found other sources to be just as affectionate in their ratings. It's all based on personal experience, of course. Three days after I got this lemon, it died (as so did 165 of my songs). I called technical support and they said, "dude, you're screwed." Luckily, Amazon refunded the entire amount.
 
 I noticed, but not pay much attention to, the reviews on this site that gumbled that their Sansas died after a few days or months. So, take a close look at those reviews. I went ahead and bought an Ipod and...as of now it has worked like a charm.
