<REVIEW>
Kevin Smith's first directing gig that he didn't write himself, "Cop Out," finds the director re-teaming with his Live Free or Die Hard  co-star, Bruce Willis, as well as Tracy Morgan and Seann William Scott, who were both featured in his 2001 film and quite possibly the biggest inside-joke put to film, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back .
 
 More than that, though, the film is a brilliant throwback to the glory days of such 80's buddy cop franchises as Lethal Weapon  and Beverly Hills Cop . You'll recognize key dialog from the former while the composer for the latter, Harold Faltermeyer, makes a glorious return to the genre with a quirky retro score that sets the mood just right. Bruce Willis plays the straight-man to Tracy Morgan's...well...Tracy Morgan is really just playing every character he's ever played here, but the way in which he bounces off of Willis (who himself seems to be trying hard to keep a straight face in many scenes) keeps it from feeling tired or stale. While this odd-couple/cop formula has been done to death in the past, it works for this film and is done in a loving way that pays tribute rather than re-hashes.
 
 Smith, whose films are mostly talk, proves himself to be a competent action director at times throughout the film. It's funny to think that the man who made Clerks  made a polished studio film such as this, but it's a sign of maturity more than selling-out, so rest easy fanboys. The script by Mark & Robb Cullen is whip-smart, witty and never leaves you longing for a laugh. Even if you don't gel with the story about a rare baseball card landing into the lap of a high-powered drug-lord, you'll always find yourself laughing along with the film. It also helps, too, that each and every player seems to have had a good time making the film, and that translates into the final result.
 
 One could make the argument that Smith himself could have re-written the film and made it all the funnier, but much of the humor in the film comes from the on-screen chemistry. It's about as good of an 80's buddy cop throwback as you'll get, and is rounded out with a brilliant cast that also includes Guillermo Diaz, Kevin Pollak, Adam Brody and Jason Lee, among others. Go into expecting a simple yet effective way of just how fun an action movie can be. As for Smith, he's shown significant range, and hopefully the film will help break him out from just being the guy who directed those Jay & Silent Bob flicks. Thankfully, "Cop Out" is anything but.
