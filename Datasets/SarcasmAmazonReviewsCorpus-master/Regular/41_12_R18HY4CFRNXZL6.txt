<REVIEW>
Well I think that this game is VERY good. In the beginning of the game you can adopt a person and name it. You can use the computer when an email sign goes up + you can have children. You get children by dragging a male onto a female or vice versa. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! You just have to get it. To do a job just go to the place where you would think they would work for their job. CLICK the details button on the bottom of the screen and it tells you the person's name, age, job, etc.
 
  I THINK THAT YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
