<REVIEW>
What a very cool product, I got it a few weeks ago and have had so much fun with it.
  
 On the plus side: 
 *Unit is small (just a bit bigger than a deck of cards)
 *it is so simple to use
 *take it anywhere and a ton of fun
 *does not need ink 
 *can run on batteries
 *bluetooth your pictures to it from you cell phone
 *There is nothing out there like it
 
 Wish it had:
 *Larger size (I hope they are working on one already)
 *longer battery life (only 15 prints per charge)
 
 I took mine on the plane last week and then to dinner, it received so much attention, what a blast. So many people were asking "what is that" and "can you take a picture of me".  I hope they come out with one that prints larger sizes. The pictures are very good quality (better than polaroid instant, but not HD quality) but then again the fun factor is what this is made for, and if you like a picture you can print as many as you want. 
 
 I give it a thumbs up, can't wait till the next model (Come on Polaroid!)
 
 For a first run, I say home run, they could tweek it a bit and it would be perfect.
