<REVIEW>
After trudging through imitations and poor sequels, I was thrilled when Puzzle Quest 2 finally arrived.  I didn't think you could improve the game play but somehow, Infinite Interactive did, with a new cleaner way to handle spells and weapons.  As you "walk" through the town, you feel more a part of the story than in Puzzle Quest 1 and this enhances the battles, as winning becomes more personal and important. This game requires more thought than quick reflexes, which allows the player to take the time to make considered decisions as you ponder which spell, weapon, and gem-match will benefit you most. With a clever mix of role play, magic and matching, I foresee hours of game-play and real enjoyment for most any age and every skill level.
