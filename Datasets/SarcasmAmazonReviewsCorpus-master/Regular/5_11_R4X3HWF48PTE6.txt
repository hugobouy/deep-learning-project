<PRODUCT>Original HP 60 Ink Cartridges Combo-Pack (Black & Tri Color) in Retail Packaging (Electronics)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
There is honestly no question that when it does come down to the best in quality printer, HP has really delivered the highest quality in ink cartridges, for their printers. That is proof with the number 60 cartridges. These are actually great and simple to install in my new deskjet printer. They deliver more ink that keeps them going well with each and every time I have to print up a project on paper. Whether it is writing up a resume, or printing coupons you need off the internet for all your shopping needs, they absolutely do the trick well. Anyone who owns a HP Printer knows what they get well in the quality of ink, and that is proof with the #60 cartridges. I absolutely recommend the 2 pack of black and color cartridges as a must have for anyone who has a heavy duty printer.
