<REVIEW>
This movie is so funny - it has situational comedy, parodies, word play, melodrama, etc..  My husband and I laughed out loud for most scenes and smiled through the rest.  The comedic talents of the actors are wonderful - their facial expressions were perfect.  The comedy is witty enough that this movie will hold up to multiple repeat viewings.  I would recommend also seeing the Kevin Costner version of Robin Hood first to appreciate the movie more, but it is not essential - Mel Brooks pokes fun enough at real life incidents.   I do know that some people may find this movie offensive (some friends of ours did).  However, in defense of Mel Brooks, he doesn't appear to be advocating any particular lifestyles, just using them as fodder for hopefully the amusement of all.  Parents might want to screen this movie first, as there is a chastity belt, a lustful "cook-witch", and some prisoners give the prison warden the bird.  That said, most of the movie doesn't offend (I don't want to give away too many jokes, but I do want you to cast your vote for the DVD - there are plenty of jokes like Little John falling into two inch deep water and needing to be rescued).  In these times of uncertainty, we need good belly laughs, and this movie provides that.
