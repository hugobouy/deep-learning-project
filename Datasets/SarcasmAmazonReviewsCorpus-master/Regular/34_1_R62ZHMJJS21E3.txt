<REVIEW>
I picked up one of these at a garage sale for $20.  I replaced a broken pickup selector switch ($13.00), installed a new set of strings, adjusted the action, intonation, and pickups.  It rocks!  I'd buy a brand new one at this price in a heartbeat.
 
 These are made by Samick, who purchased the Silvertone name to directly sell their guitars in America instead of just building guitars for other manufacturers.  The Epiphone SG Custom was manufactured by Samick for Epiphone/Gibson for a while.  I saw one with exactly the same inspection sticker as my yard-sale Silvertone!
 
 My unit is fairly beat up, but some touch up with a black Sharpie prettied it up quite a bit.  I suspect that the switch was broken when the guitar did a face plant at some point.  Buy a guitar stand if you order one of these.  Despite all of this, the neck on mine was dead-straight after a slight adjustment of the truss rod.
 
 I love mine.  I'll bet you like yours once you get it set up correctly.   I'm eyeing that SSLA-30 Blues Master (http://www.amazon.com/Silvertone-Master-Electric-Guitar-Transparent/dp/B000189YBW) as my next electric guitar.
 
 I'm sold on Silvertone guitars.
