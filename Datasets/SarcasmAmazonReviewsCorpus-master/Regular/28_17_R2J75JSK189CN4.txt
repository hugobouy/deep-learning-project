<REVIEW>
I cannot really understand why one of the previous reviewers had those problems. With the Gamepad comes an installation program (Version 4.3a) and after installing you have a whole bunch of options to choose from to setup your controller. Once you figured out how to set it up right (very good manual), the controller works flawlessly in all my games without any problems. Both analog and digital controls are usable. The buttons are good to reach and the handling is better than every other controller i had before. I changed from a MS Sidewinder Pro Gamepad to this one because my thumbs hurt after only a couple of minutes playing with the MS Product. This is much better. Very ergonomic! I cannot give 5 stars though, because the &quot;Aftershock&quot; feature is not impressive, but i really couldn't care less about this.
