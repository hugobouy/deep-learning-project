<REVIEW>
Family Ties of Danielle Steel is one of her best. I have enjoyed Danielle Steels last 2 books very much.
 I am not going to go into a storyline here about the book, however, I urge Steel lovers to buy this book and enjoy the story lines of all four characters; Annie, Ted, Katie, and Liz.  Each character is faced with life's choices and decisions (especially Ted - I was rooting for him; I enjoyed his storyline the most)!
 Okay, enough...buy this Danielle Steel - it's fun.
