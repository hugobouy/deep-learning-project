<REVIEW>
I bought one of these before for $49.99, now it's on sale for $29.99, what a great deal.  This DVD player is excellent quality, which is something I expect from Sony.  Just about all the audio & video equipment I have at home are Sony brand, even though they are usually a bit overpriced, I'm just use to their menu system and stable quality. 
 
 Playability - Sony DVD players don't play the burned or foreign DVDs, this is an exception.  It plays the Chinese Drama DVD's perfectly fine.  Not that I encourage pirating DVDs, but this one plays those self burned backup DVDs as well.  
 
 Quality - The last one I got is about 1 year old now, plays perfectly fine.  We use it about 2 hours every day.  Even at $50, it's worth the $ by now. 
 
 Menu system - Well, I don't use much of the functions, but the fast forward is in place.  Samsung has a wierd fast forward where it's 2x, 4x, ( too slow)  then 64x ( way too fast).  Also, this player will remember multiple DVD stop locations even after you remove it.  Now that's really cool.
