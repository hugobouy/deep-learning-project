<REVIEW>
I was very wary of buying a composite cable for my iPhone, not knowing if it would work with the 3GS, or with the 3.0 software. This cable works! It plugs into the yellow/red/white ports on your TV, and has a USB port for power. I bought mine for use with my car stereo (JVC KW-AVX710 7-Inch In-Dash Double-DIN CD/DVD/MP3/iPod Bluetooth-Ready Touchscreen Receiver ) using a USB car charger (Scosche Dual USB Car Charger ) and, except for the very minor inconvenience of having to control my movies through the iPhone and not on the screen, I havent had a single problem yet. In fact, I am buying another for home use!
