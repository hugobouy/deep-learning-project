<REVIEW>
Hellhound on his Trail is an outstanding book.  Sides writes about all that happened before and after  the assasination of ML King In Memphis in 1968.  His writing style is captivating at a minimum.  Even though we know how it turns out, I couldn't put the book down.  The reader learns what is going on inside the King organization prior to the killing and what is going on with the assassin, James Earl Ray.  The author is from Memphis and his love and concern for the city shows in the way he invovles Memphis in the unfolding drama.  The tension around the actual shooting, and the unbelievably thorough search for Ray were the best parts of the book for me.  By the time the good guys have Ray under arrest, I felt like I had grown to actually know him.  I would have liked to see the author wrtie a bit more about the trial and Ray's time in prison, but I guess the book had to have boundaries.  A great, and fun read.  Unqualified five star recommendation
