<REVIEW>
The Culture Warrior by Blll O'Reilly provides a reader with powerful principals for change. It is the first book I have read by O'Reilly and have found his writing to be pleasant.  I found this book to be enjoyable as it describes the most effective people should be value centered, which is the key for long term success.  The book went on to describe where people are dependent and need others to get what they want while independent people can get what they want by their own effort.  The paradigms presented in the Culture Warrior by O'Reilly can assist individuals in their professional work and more importantly in their personal lives. I give this book a thumbs up and a must read.
