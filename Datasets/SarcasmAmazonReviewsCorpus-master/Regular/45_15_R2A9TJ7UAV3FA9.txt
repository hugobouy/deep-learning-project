<PRODUCT>LG 600G Prepaid Phone with Double Minutes for Life (Tracfone) (Wireless Phone)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
The LG600G is an excellent phone!  
 
 Transferring my minutes and phone number from my old TracFone was painless using Tracfone's website, and I didn't have to wait days for the transfer to be complete.  It was done just as soon as I was finished on their web page!!
 
 Bluetooth works excellent!  I easily paired it with my GPS, earpiece,  and laptop.  
 
 I've been using it for a few days now, and have not experienced any dropped calls, always good connections.  The camera is very basic, but I already have a camera, and I didn't buy this for the camera.
 
 It comes from Tracfone with free double minutes for life, and if you can afford to buy large blocks of minutes, Tracfone usually has good bonus minute deals.  So far, with the package I got through HSN, my costs have been less than $0.08 per minute!
 
 Everyone I have spoken with over this phone say that my voice is nice and clear.  And they sound good to me!  All in all, the LG600G from Tracfone has been a very good deal for me!
