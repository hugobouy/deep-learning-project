<REVIEW>
I first read this book when I was 16, and I've received a lot of Dianetics auditing since then. I also re-read it twice. However, I never had my own copy (used friends') so I decided to pick up my own book from Amazon today. 
 
 I was shocked to see the vast morass of negative reviews on this book! It seems to be a whole bunch of people who are biased against Hubbard and Scientology in general. They obviously have limited comprehension of the material because their reviews seem to have more to do with their opinions of Hubbard and Scientology than they do of Dianetics.
 
 I personally have had a lot of fun with Dianetics therapy and I believe I've improved myself a lot, too. After reading this book I was practically itching to try it. Since then I've had dozens of hours "in the chair" both auditing and as a preclear on Dianetics. The book makes it easy! Plus, the edition I had gave you a "how-to" card which laid out all the steps for you in summarized form. I can only hope this newer edition has the same thing. 
 
 It's likely my review won't even be read by many, as the first several pages of reviews are all negative. However, if you've slogged through them because you believe someone MUST have had something nice to say about it - take a chance on this book. I and many of my friends will vouch for it in a heartbeat.
