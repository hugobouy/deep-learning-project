<REVIEW>
I'm suspecting that there are two types of people who are approaching this DVD, a filmed version of the stage production of "Jekyll & Hyde".  One, someone familiar with the show--perhaps saw it and liked it or has the soundtrack--and wants to check out this variation.  Or two, someone discovering it anew.  It tempts me to write two reviews because while I love "Jekyll & Hyde", it's slightly unfortunate that this is the production most people will get a chance to judge.
 
 So let me preface this by saying that I really am a fan of this show.  Some people consider "Jekyll" sort of a "Phantom-lite".  I, myself, have never been the biggest supporter of "Phantom of the Opera".  It's fine, full of bombast, but hardly the revolutionary experience that people give it credit for.  "Jekyll" does play to similar themes, but has a stronger overall soundtrack.  Instead of a couple of showstoppers like "Phantom", "Jekyll" is filled with memorable power ballads.  Not the most complicated show musically, it is very accessible.  And when you have great singers, these simpler and emotionally charged songs become pop opera and quite moving.
 
 So, without hesitation, I recommend the original Broadway Cast recording!!!  Robert Cuccioli, Linda Eder and Christiane Noll are superb.  You couldn't hope for better.
 
 But here's the problem with this DVD, it's not this great cast--NO, the star is David Hasselhoff.  So you see my problem, don't you?  Look, I'm not going to be unkind--it's an easy target.  Let's just say this.  If you're a fan of the show, he doesn't completely ruin it.  And it's not like there are any other versions to add to your collections.  If you are new to the show, I'm still recommending it provisionally.  I wish there were another option.  If you like the show, though--and I think you will--please rush over and buy the 1997 Cast recording.  Treat yourself to how "Jekyll & Hyde" should really sound.    KGHarris, 10/06.
