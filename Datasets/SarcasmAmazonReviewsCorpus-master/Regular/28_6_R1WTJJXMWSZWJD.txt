<REVIEW>
I have had this compressor for a couple of weeks now and really like it.  It is a high quality unit clearly built to last.  I chose this model over the very popular oil-free pancake compressors mainly for it's compact size and low noise level....and it did not dissappoint me.  I would say this unit is half as loud as those typical oil-fee models by P*rter C*ble.  I can easly run it indoors while remodeling a bedroom, and hardly hear in the room next door. The unit is compact, but much heavier duty than similar Cr*ftman compressors I saw at Sears.  It recycles quickly and fills the tank in less than 20 seconds.  It came with a good owner's manual and a bottle of oil.  I did have a problem where the plastic oil filler cap was cracked, but Makita quickly sent me a replacement part under warantee.  I would recommend this unit to anyone looking for an occasional use compressor and does not want something large or loud.
