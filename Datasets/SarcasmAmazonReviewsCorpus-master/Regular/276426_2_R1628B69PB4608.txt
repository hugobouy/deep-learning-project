<REVIEW>
This was recommended to us as the next best thing to breast feeding, when those weren't available for one reason or another.  In our case, this was used primarily when daughter and daddy (me) were together without mommy.  
 
 Objectively, it's got the good stuff per the label:  Organic, DHA, and iron fortified.  Given what you hear about harmful agents in food, it gave my wife and I peace of mind knowing that this is organic.  
 
 Subjectively, our daughter loved it and didn't give any pause when gulping it down.  In fact, she seemed to dig it, usually sucking the bottle dry in short order.  I've heard that some babies can be finicky when it comes to formula, but we had no such experience with this product.  Indeed, we tried others that didn't seem as satisfying.  My much more mature taste buds also gave this a thumb's up, finding it tasty and smooth, though admittedly I had only cow's milk to compare.  On the practical side, this mixed up quickly and completely with water; it was smooth and creamy, with no un-disolved clumps or grittiness.  I used to pre-measure some in bottles when we went out so I could just add water and shake it up and that worked great.  
 
 The best testimonial I can give, other than saying that it pleased our daughter's discerning palate, is that this is the only formula I will use for our next child.
