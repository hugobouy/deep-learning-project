<REVIEW>
This is a great book. It's not what I expected - in a good way. The quality far exceeded my expectations - 100% full-color and packed with pictures, diagrams, charts, quotes, cartoons, and lots of Glenn's trademark "A.D.D." observations. Not what you get in a standard book of political commentary. The Presidential Smackdown is hilarious. But in spite of all that, the information contained in the book is excellent and it's presented in a way that makes it easy to understand and helps you see through the so-called "facts" that are being thrown at you from every direction, from media, from government, and from a generally uninformed populace. Highly recommended for anyone interested in liberty and freedom.
