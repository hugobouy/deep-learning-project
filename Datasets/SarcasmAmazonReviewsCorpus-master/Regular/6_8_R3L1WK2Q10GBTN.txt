<REVIEW>
Wireless works great.  Sound is decent from the size of the speakers.  I did hook it up to larger front towers, and that makes it excellent!  Overall this is a great device to go along with your LG tv.  One point of note, if you have this, you do not need the wireless dongle that is sold separately for the tv.  All the same features are in this device, ie. Netflix,Pandora,Vudu,etc.. the only draw back without using the dongle is you have to have this turned on and the sound will need to come from it rather than the tv.  Not really a big deal as you would probably want it on anyway if streaming a movie or music.  It will also turn on and off automatically with the tv, as well as turning the tv on when it is turned on.  Great thinking on LG's part.  Make sure you update the firmware as the menus are very slow without it.  Actually come to think of it, that was automatic after finding the network.  LG did a great job combining all these features into a tiny package.  I'm an Audiophile and never thought I would accept the sound quality of such a device, but come to find out I do!  All of my other equipment is high end, and I can honestly say for the price/features this device has, it delivers.  Build quality is ok for what it is.  I would have liked it to have a little more heft and a powered subwoofer rather than passive, but again given what it can do it's a nice piece of equipment.  If you are looking for a nice compact solution with decent sound for a living room I would go for it.
