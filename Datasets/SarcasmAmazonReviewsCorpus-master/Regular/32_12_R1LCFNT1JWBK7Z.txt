<REVIEW>
I just bought this camera, and from what I can tell so far it's pretty good. Pros: 
 1.) Takes really clear pictures
 2.) Nice BIG screen
 3.) comes in a cool color
 4.) Plays videos through windows media
 
 Cons:
 1.) So far the only thing which isn't so bad is the shutter-lag. My old Kodak use to take super quick pics, this one is still fast, but not as fast as my old camera. 
 
 In general, this is a good camera i would recommend.
