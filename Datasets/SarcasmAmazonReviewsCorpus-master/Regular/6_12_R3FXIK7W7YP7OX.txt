<REVIEW>
Can't think of anything bad about it.  I use it everyday ripping 2x stock and building cabinets and furniture projects. Works good for dado operations, has an accurate fence and easy extendable table.  Saw has plenty of power for most operations.  The portability of this saw is great and easily stores away when not in use.
