<PRODUCT>George W. Bush on God and Country: The President Speaks Out About Faith, Principle, and Patriotism (Hardcover)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
I found this book to be encouraging and intriguing. I learned a lot about the heart and compassion of President Bush. The book will help the reader realize the depth of President Bush's Christian faith and what motivates his leadership. He has always seemed sincere to me, but now through this book he has become even more real. It seems he cares about all aspects of our nation and each individual in it. Read this book for a fresh perspective and get away from the rehtoric of the common media.
