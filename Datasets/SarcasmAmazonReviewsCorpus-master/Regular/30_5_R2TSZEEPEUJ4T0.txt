<REVIEW>
I am very pleased with my purchase.  The kettle has a solid feel and looks very attractive in my kitchen. It heats quickly and when pouring, the steam does not rise up and hit my hand.  The color is perfect and spatters clean off the finish easily.  The cover fits securely.  The water tastes fresh and clean, unlike another metal kettle I purchased some time ago which imparted an unpleasant taste to the water.  All in all, I'm very happy with it. I would recommend this item to anyone who wishes to purchase it.  Thanks Kitchenaid for a quality product.
