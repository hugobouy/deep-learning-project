<REVIEW>
Our son received this as a gift before he turned 1. Although he could not sort the blocks then, he started trying. It was amazing to watch him over the next year change the way he played with the toy. Initially he just played with the blocks, then threw them in the bucket, dumped them out again. He would also carry the bucket with blocks around by the handle. Later he was able to put in the round one, then another and within a short time all of them. He still likes playing with it. It was apparent that he had a sense of achievement after each new "accomplishment". I highly recommend this toy.
