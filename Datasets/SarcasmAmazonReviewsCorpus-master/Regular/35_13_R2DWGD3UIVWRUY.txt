<REVIEW>
I was concerned that, given the price, it would be cheap.  I was happily surprised!  The rings are  machined, but it looks terrific.  You can expect to pay three times the price for a similar piece on other sites.  Probably too small for someone over a size "large", unless slim of build.  The rings are steel, so it's heavy!  I recommend it highly.
