<REVIEW>
Great product. Made from very dense board of some type, speckled gray finish goes well with my car's interior, easy mounting, holds 15" laptop, can be used as a table for eating fast food, easily stows under seat. You can get it direct from the manufacturer for $23.75 shipped, fast. If Wally World carried it, it would probably cost $10. Must be the weird "moral outrage" against it. Get a couple while they're still legal.
