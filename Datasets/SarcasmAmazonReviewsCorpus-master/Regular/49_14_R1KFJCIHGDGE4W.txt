<REVIEW>
After thoroughly enjoying Tom Goes to the Major, and the first season of TAEASGJ, I was overjoyed when they got a contract for more seasons. Then I tuned in...
 
 Somehow, the novelty wore off, and the cleverness disappeared. Was it just filler? Were they burnt out and wanting out of their contract? Instead of getting better a lot of bits were so poor in comparison. While watching this season I felt embarrassed for the comedians I normally enjoy. 
 
 Looking into the dead eyes of the main stars, it seems like they sold their soul for a longer contract. And when they lost that they also lost their ability to be funny and clever.
