<REVIEW>
Followed the directions carefully to hang a small towel bar just like the picture shows on the package. Within 5 minutes everything crashed to the floor. So I started over, even taped the towel bar in place for extra support. Waited 24 hours to remove the tape, instant crash to the floor. This stuff doesn't work, AND they give you one glove, not 2, for those of us with sensitive skin. It is hard to knead with just one hand.
