<REVIEW>
I have never written a review before but I have to say that this product is one of the best things that I've ever bought. I am a terrible typer and this allows me to write reports about twice as fast and without all the headache of correction. I almost didn't buy this product because of all of the terrible reviews on Amazon.com.
 
 It seems that if you are using Vista, or are an English as a 2nd language student, or have a very old computer then you might have problems using Dragon. I have 2 GB of RAM on 2005 HP Pavilion laptop running XP
 
 I understand that people are not happy with tech support but I have yet to use it. Also when loading the software I also faced a C++ error message that was a headache but I was able to fix it with a simple Google search.
 
 Last year I had my Mac stolen, but now I couldn't be happier because now I can use the software on my new XP, that I couldn't have used if I still had a Mac.
 
 I'm using the software to type this review and I would say that it has made perhaps 2 errors, but that is understandable given that sometimes I speak quickly and there is some ambiguity in what I'm writing.
 
 I can honestly say that the software has changed my life. I love my job now!
