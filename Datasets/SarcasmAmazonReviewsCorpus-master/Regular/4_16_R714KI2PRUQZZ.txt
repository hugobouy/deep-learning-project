<REVIEW>
I received this as a gift and it brought back a lot of memories.  I really loved it.  I'm not sure why there are some people who are disappointed because some of the candy is still available today.  That is very puzzling.  The candy names are right in the description.  You know before you buy it exactly what is in it.
