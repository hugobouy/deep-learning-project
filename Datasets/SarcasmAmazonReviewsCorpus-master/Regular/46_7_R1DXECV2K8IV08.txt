<PRODUCT>Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right (Hardcover)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
Ann's books is an excellent portrayal of the liberal bias in the American media that is constantly promoting immoral, irresponsible, irrelevant people and ideas that are harmful to the future survival of this nation. Coulter's book can be described as nothing more than brillant and should be in the hands of every journalism student in America, so that they will not fall into the trap of subjective liberal ideology.
