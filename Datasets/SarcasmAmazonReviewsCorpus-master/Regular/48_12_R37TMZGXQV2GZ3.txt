<REVIEW>
As caveats, I would describe my beard density as significantly below average and I have fairly sensitive skin.  I have generally shaved with a double bladed razor in the past, but I have had problems with irritation of my neck.  This little shaver comes fairly close to a razor shave on the face and is, on a whole, better on the neck, with significantly less irritation.  I have taken to keeping one at work and another in my gym bag.
