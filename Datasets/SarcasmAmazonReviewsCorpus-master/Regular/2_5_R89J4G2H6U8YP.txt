<REVIEW>
When I first saw the cover of this paperback in a Georgetown, DC, bookshop a few years ago, I was hesitant to buy it.  Simply put, the cover is goofy, and does not do this masterpiece any justice.  I am so grateful that I  ignored my initial instinct, as I don't remember ever reading a funnier  book in the English language than the late John Kennedy Toole's life  achievement, nor is there a more memorable character in American literature  than I. J. Reilly.  The work deserves a 6 star rating!  &quot;A Confederacy  of Dunces&quot; is more than just incredibly funny, however.  It is  unusually poignant, gut-wrenchingly sad, and an admirable observation piece  on a rather decadent and seemingly lost segment of our society sitting at  the mouth of the Mississippi River.  I have visited New Orleans three times  since 1994 for varied reasons, and the city apparently has not changed in  the least since Mr. Toole's late 1960s rendition.  His characters continue  to stroll and struggle along Bourbon Street and Canal Street, and their  troubled spirits infuse every alley and cave of the French Quarter.  Just  like the district surrounding St. Peter's Square in the city of jazz,  Ignatius J. Reilly is out of step with the rest of America.  In spite of  his repulsive and grossly comical physical presence, he believes in  aesthetics and real meaning, in what he perceives to be the truth.  For  this reason, he is a true literary hero, like Don Quixote, Cyrano de  Bergerac and the Good Soldier Schweik before him.     One final note:  before you buy this book, think about cancelling all your appointments and  engagements for the two or three days that follow.  They, along with eating  and sleeping, undoubtedly will be totally neglected until you finish this  400 page tour de farce.
