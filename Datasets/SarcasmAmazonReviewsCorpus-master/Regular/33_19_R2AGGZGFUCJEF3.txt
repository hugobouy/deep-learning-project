<REVIEW>
I bought this MP3 player for my husband and after he had it about 2 weeks it just stopped working.  I called sandisk and asked them if there was something i could try at home instead of returning it, but the guy said it's broken and that I should return it. My husband and I decided that we did not want another MP3 player from this company because it took us forever to download all his music and then the item broke.  So beware before you buy this product.  I saw one bad review before I bought the product and thought, what the heck, but I wish I would have listened to that reviewer.
