<REVIEW>
I'm quite pleased with the size, and sound of this little charger/player.  It will work great in our small RV and not take up tons of space.  I especially like that it is small and it charges my Nano as well as plays it.  The sound is not your big bold booming stereo sound, but not bad for a little set of speakers.  Will work for me and what I'm needing it for, and  I'm ordering 2 more for my grandsons' Nanos as well.
