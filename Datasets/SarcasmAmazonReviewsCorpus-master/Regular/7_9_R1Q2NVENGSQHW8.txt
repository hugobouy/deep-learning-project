<REVIEW>
I don't care about the looks, I'm just a fan of the music... And I'm not 12 years old, mind you, and neither are many of the other people who found &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot; likable -- many adults like Hanson, too. I  don't care how many CDs you have, and I don't care about your life story,  either. You've got to relize something about Hanson and &quot;Middle of  Nowhere&quot;. This was written/co-written and co-produced by the band  Hanson themselves, when Ike was 16, Tay was 14, and when Zac was 11. You  have got to be crazy not to think that these boys (yes, they are boys) are  talented. You have to admit it, even if you don't like their music. What's  more, they play their own instruments. Why don't you go bother BSB or *N  SYNC or something because, unlike the hard working Hanson bros., they don't  write their music, they don't write their lyrics, they don't play  instruments for their music, and their music isn't good anyway. But take  &quot;M.O.N.&quot;:  It's not my favorite, but I really like it a lot. The  songs were written from the band's personal expriences (&quot;With You In  Your Dreams&quot; and &quot;MMMBop&quot;- you just have to listen to the  words) and what teens really feel and think (&quot;Weird&quot;,  &quot;Thinking of You&quot;, ect., ect.). All *N SYNC ever sings about is  breaking up with some girl, still loving that girl, and wanting her back.  One theme. On one of Hanson's very mature songs, &quot;Weird&quot; (which  happens to be my favorite Hanson song), they sing about feeling left out  and wishing someone was there who understood them. I don't care how old you  are, everyone has felt that why or will feel that way or do feel that way.  &quot;Thinking of You&quot; is about a boy with a crush on some girl, but  can't be with her (I guess because he can't tell her how he feels about  her). Everyone feels like that. &quot;With You In Your Dreams&quot; was  written by Hanson alone for their dieing grandmother. I don't care what you  say, these boys DO have talent, even if you think this CD is bad or  good! My favorits: &quot;Weird&quot; (my most fave), &quot;MMMBop&quot;,  &quot;Madeline&quot;, &quot;Yearbook&quot;, and &quot;Look  at You,  Baby&quot;. I really don't like &quot;Thinking of You&quot; and  &quot;Lucy&quot;, but they're okay. The rest of the songs are really  good, too. They don't really sound like the Jackson 5, but some of  Hanson's songs have a 60's and 70's sound to them. Also, &quot;Weird&quot;,  &quot;Yearbook&quot;, &quot;I Will Come To You&quot;, and &quot;With You In  Your Dreams&quot; are very mature and are NOT (I repeat; NOT)  &quot;teeny-bopper&quot;!
