<REVIEW>
Other reviewers have rightly observed that, although THE HELP is a rollicking good story, it lacks depth, nuance, and a good editing. The characters are, indeed, caricatures. I encourage everyone who has praised this book to take a few minutes to read William Faulkner's short story "That Evening Sun." Faulkner says more in a few pages about black domestics than Stockett says in 444. And he says it beautifully.
