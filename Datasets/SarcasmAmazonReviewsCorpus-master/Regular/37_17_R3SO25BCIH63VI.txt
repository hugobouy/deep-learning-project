<REVIEW>
I hadn't heard much about Vantage Point before going to see it in the dollar theaters last week, and I must say this film deserved a lot more attention than it seems to have gotten. The concept of the movie (which is hinted at in the title) is what especially makes Vantage Point a compelling and unique film; I won't address the pattern it revolves around directly since it comes as a nice surprise, but the vantage points by which the movie progresses are very entertaining and suspenseful. Just when I thought I had figured out everything about what was going on, I was not even close. Plenty of twists, thrilling action scenes, and surprises make this movie a must-see. The acting is all tremendous as well; my only criticisms would be the tendency of the film to have parts which were incredibly unrealistic. These parts still contributed to the entertaining nature of Vantage Point, however, and so they didn't bother me much. Overall, this movie combines a unique setting with a fascinating plotline to make one solid film. I would rate Vantage Point four and a half of five stars and highly recommend seeing it. One of my favorite movies so far this year.
