<REVIEW>
This is the best waffle maker I have ever owned.  I made waffles for a gang at our work holiday party with rave reviews.  Easy to use and they come out perfect everytime.  The reminder beeps are helpful to know when they are done.  Just put the batter in, flip it and wait for the beep!  It is a special treat when I pull this out in the morning.
