<REVIEW>
I am an Office Manager for a property management firm in Downtown Chicago.  I purchased this Panasonic microwave for the office because I own two other Panasonic microwaves at my personal properties and I am delighted with the brand.
 
 This microwave not only looks nice and clean, but it stands up to use and abuse of the employees.  I also have not had any complaints that it doesn't heat food properly.  I would certainly recommend this microwave to anybody.
