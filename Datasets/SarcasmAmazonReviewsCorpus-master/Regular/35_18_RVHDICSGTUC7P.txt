<REVIEW>
Let's face it:  If you are conservative then you probably will agree with Rush but if you lean towards liberal then you probably can't stand him.
 
 In my case, I've read Rush's first book "The Way Things Ought  to Be" and found it to be full of inaccuracies, unsubstantiated and  outrageous claims, and misinformation.  That's not to say Rush is a complete moron because he does put forth some good arguments, but overall,  I think Al Franken proves his case to convince me that Rush is a (big fat)  idiot.
 
 I like this book because it is hysterically funny and quite  entertaining.  Al's wit is dry and sometimes vicious.  I laughed to tears  when I read the chapter about Phil Gramm ("I own more guns than I  need, but not as many as I want.")
 
 He lampoons the right wing, and I  think he does it well.  If you are a conservative with no sense of humor,  you will not like this book.
