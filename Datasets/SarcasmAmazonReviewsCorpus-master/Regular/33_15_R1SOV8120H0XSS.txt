<REVIEW>
I've been using Alli now since the middle of November, and I've lost 12 pounds, on schedule with the promised 1-2 pounds of safe weight loss per week.  They have a very robust online support site for people who purchase the pills and it provides useful tracking of weight loss and encouragement in more ways than I can use.  The treatment effects that you read about are what keeps people honest with Alli and essentially make it work -- if you eat too much fat at one sitting, you'll be visiting the bathroom quite frequently.  You learn quick.  I made it through the holidays with continued weight loss, which I view as an amazing feat.  I have 13 more pounds to lose on my plan and I'll weigh what I did before I had my two kids.  Easy to use, promotes healthy eating habits and lifestyle changes, and self-critiquing when you stray from the plan.  I would recommend Alli to others -- it's a little pricy but I'm getting my money's worth out of it.
