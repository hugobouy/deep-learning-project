<REVIEW>
Got one of these from Fry's in a MB/CPU combo deal.  The processor is smoking fast with software that takes advantage of all 4 cores efficiently.  Examples would be Photoshop, Vegas, Winrar, Lightwave, Nero etc.  I got it specifically for crunching high definition video in Sony Vegas and editing high res graphics in Photoshop.  The processor really makes short work of previously long processing tasks.
