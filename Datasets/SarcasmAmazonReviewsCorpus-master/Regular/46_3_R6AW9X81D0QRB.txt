<PRODUCT>UVSunSense UV Monitoring Wristbands: 7 Pack (Misc.)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
didnt realize there is a little more to them than just putting on your wrist...gave to 5yr and 8 yr old and the parents and although a good monitoring device,not too sure I would do again...Not bad though!!!!! was fun for the kids watching the bands change.!
