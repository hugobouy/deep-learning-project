<PRODUCT>Timex T5G941 Heart Rate Monitor Watch (Sports)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
My Timex Heart Monitor arrived today and, after a quick read of the enclosed instructions, I strapped on the watch and the sensor unit and headed for the Oz fitness center.  
 
 The Timex seemed to work perfectly.  It was consistent first with my resting pulse rate.  And at the gym the Star Trec Treadmill picked up the signal and registered the same as it did yesterday when I didn't have the Timex unit.  
 
 I'm 70 years old.  It was really great to NOT have to grab the treadmill sensors with both hands to check my pulse while jogging 6+MPH.   The new Star Trec treadmill picked up the Timex signal and displayed my heart rate so I didn't even have to look at the watch.  Of course it comes in handy on the rowing machine and the torso machine, acting as an incentive to push to my maximum heart rate.  
 
 It may be that the watch battery (or more likely the sensor battery) will run down after a couple of months of daily use.  I don't actually know how long the batteries will last or how resilient the unit is to abuse.  
 I hope it will outlast the cheap but comfortable plastic watch band.  Now that I have used it once I don't want to jog, bicycle, or go the gym without it.
