Not only is this bag look and feel good, it has plenty of space for my 15" widescreen laptop, files/folders, back up drive, all accessories, and wireless mouse...even has a number of exterior pockets for phone, water bottle, etc. Bag has nice padding in the back along with heavy duty straps and a sturdy top handle. All for a decent price.
