<REVIEW>
Pretty good sci-fi/action/horror/semi-comedy. Probably a must-have for sci-fi collectors and definitely a must-have for Natasha Henstridge fans. The best parts (and most humorous) are the scenes where Sil (Henstridge) is trying to figure out how to operate in Earthly society. I would have given the show five stars if a couple more such scenes were included in place of some of the slower and/or more predictable scenes in the latter half of the film.
