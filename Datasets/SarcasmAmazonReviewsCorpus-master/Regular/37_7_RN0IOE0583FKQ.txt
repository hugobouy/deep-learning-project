<REVIEW>
Very Nice camera.
 
 Pros:
 
 Controls are intuitive.  
 Battery charge time is minimal.
 Video and sound quality is good.  It's not HD, what do you expect?
 Software works seemlessly with Windows 7.
 Portability. (Fits in your pocket)
 Zoom, focus and adjustments to different lighting conditions are fast.
 
 Cons:
 
 Software could include a couple more options, like alternate soundtrack capability, and the e-mail function is a little vague.
 
 Summation:  Well worth the price.  If you want HD quality, this may not be for you.  If you want ease of operation and portability, look no further.
