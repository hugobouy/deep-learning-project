<REVIEW>
I bought these bibles to give as gifts to my friends that love stock car racing. They were impressed with the stories of the race drivers they found in the bible. I gave one to my church to help reach  young people that might otherwise not pickup a bible. I wish they would make one for motorcycle riders.  I am a member of CMA and would use this as an outreach tool.  Chris Cline, Overland Park, KS
