<REVIEW>
I got this book because I wanted something that I could use to help teach my son his ABC's.  I bought it when he was about 15 months and immediately he enjoyed the book.  We would sing the song, read through the entire book, I'd point out the letters etc.  I find this book a very helpful starting point for learning the alphabet, a fun way!  One idea for younger toddlers, when I started we'd just read the letter and skip the other info on the page.  This way the book was more managable for my toddlers short attention span.  I have to say though, he really likes this book. Esp. when we first got it he'd literally sit down with the book and just flip through the pages.  A++
