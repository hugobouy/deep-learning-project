<REVIEW>
I found several reviews of other Yamaha keyboards that had a grand piano built in, and several of them pointed to this one as a huge value for the price.  The internal Piano sounds are very good, but you only have about 5 or 6 sounds.  I didn't buy it for the internal sounds.  I bought it because of its semi-weighted and graded keys, and the fact that it had a Midi in/out port.  Many of the current generation of entry-level Yamaha keyboards now have just a USB port for interface with a computer over a midi chipset, but lack that actual MIDI ports for connecting to other midi equipment.  This keyboard has the midi ports.
 
 Its also very lightweight and genuinely portable.  My only complaint was that the description said it shipped with a power adapter, and it did not. Most of the sites I checked said the power adapter was sold separately, so I was surprised that it was listed here on Amazon with it...but then it wasn't included.
