<REVIEW>
I love my DROID....this phone is AweSomE!!, it has spoiled me 2 death with all it does. I'm always on it, I feel like a kid in a candy store knowing it's mine and on my hip @ all times..IDK why it took me so long 2get a smartphone, but I'm glad that I have one now. I am also a keyboard person, so having one was a must...I don't really care 4 the touch screen keypad, and I don't use the one on the DROID, I NEED 2 feel the keys if U will, lol...It's simply WonDerFul!!
 
 I'm truly a HapPy CamPer!!
