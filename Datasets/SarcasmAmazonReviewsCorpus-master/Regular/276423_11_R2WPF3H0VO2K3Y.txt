<REVIEW>
I purchased this to go with my new bike because I end up riding home late after work sometimes and in the city a light is a requirement.  But this package comes with two products.  The headlamp and a tail light.
 
 Headlamp - This thing is great.  I love the ability to switch between the Xenon bulb and the dual LEDs.  The Xenon is very bright, more than adequate for night riding.  The LEDs are a nice backup because the provide you with a nearly indispensable source of light as they use very little battery power.  But if you find yourself running low it will automatically switch to a "Take Me Home" mode that uses less power for those long treks home (or unexpected detours).  What gets me is a friend of mine purchased a much more expensive headlamp and this thing blows his out of the water.
 
 Tail Light - This is why I gave the review four stars.  This product at first seemed just as good as the headlamp.  Plenty of options (on, blink, blink faster, varied LEDs cycling, and fast cycle).  After mounting it I went to angle it down a bit and the casing came right off (the way your replace the batteries).  The casing is rather poorly made, the bottom clip doesn't hold so well, it could be just mine but the design seems flawed.  I had to remove it because a rough bump could easily knock it off and then it would be lost forever.  A little bit of tape on the bottom solved this problem for me so it wasn't a complete loss.
 
 Overall the products are nice.  The headlamp made this purchase worth it for me since I already have a backup (reserve) tail light.
 
 Best Wishes...
