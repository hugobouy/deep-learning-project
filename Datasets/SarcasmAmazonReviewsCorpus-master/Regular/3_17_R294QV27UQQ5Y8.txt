<PRODUCT>Toshiba Mini NB305-N410BL 10.1-Inch Royal Blue Netbook - 11 Hours of Battery Life (Personal Computers)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
I had been looking at the various netbooks for a while and really liked Toshiba's NB205 but just couldn't get around the negative comments on battery placement and speaker quality.  The NB305 was specifically designed to address these concerns - different battery placement and two speakers instead of just the one on the 205.  
 
 As for things this shares with the 205:  The chiklet keyboard just rocks - space between the keys goes a long way towards cutting down on the mistypes that you get on the keyboards where the keys are merging one into the next.  It may not matter to many people but if you have a long haired cat or dog that sheds and likes to spend time in your lap the fact that this is a much easier keyboard to keep pet hair out of is a huge plus as well.  Having two separate mouse buttons instead of one rocker bar is handy for those of us who like to actually use the right click.  Keyboard layout as a whole is very "touch type" friendly so those who actually learned how to type on a real keyboard or -gasp- typewriter can actually use this keyboard.  Portability is also another huge plus, when it's closed this little guy doesn't have much more of a footprint than a decent sized hard cover book and while I realize that this just means it's a netbook as somebody who still remembers his high school computer lab having IBM PS-2's it's still amazing.
 
 In an effort to make this a true review I'll also hit a few of the things that are shortcomings for the NB305.  Is this going to let you watch high def movies - no.  Is this going to let you play World of Warcraft or other graphic intensive games - no.  Are you going to be able to multi-task 5 different RAM intensive applications - be serious you only have 1G of RAM or 2G if you upgrade.  
 
 The reason I'm giving such a great rating to this netbook is that having said all of the things that the NB305 - and for that matter netbooks in general - can't do the simple fact is that I don't want to do and wouldn't expect to do those things on a 10.1 in screen to begin with.  If you want to play games there are laptops targeted for that market, if you want to watch HD video get a laptop with a blue-ray not something that doesn't even have an optical media drive.  You can get a laptop that plays games - full discloser I have one, handles HD video and/or serves as near "desk top replacements" and you can get them for not a lot more than you will spend to get the NB305, what you will not get is the portability.  Personally I want something to check my email, check headlines on the web, watch the occasional You-Tube, do word processing, handle I-Tunes and allow me to use a Citrix client to access the work related apps on a server when I'm away from the office and still fit in my briefcase.  This little guy fits the bill and looks good doing it - thanks Toshiba.
