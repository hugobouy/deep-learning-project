<REVIEW>
I love the idea of the glamourmom nursing tank tops but when I got mine in the mail, I was shocked by the inner lining of the bra tank!  The part that goes around your areola is an itchy, meshy material.  This makes it really uncomfortable for anyone experiencing nipple soreness.  Also, you can't sleep in this top because when you roll over in your sleep, your breasts will slide and rub against this itchy, inner lining.  I think I'm going to cut out the lining and just wear the cotton tank by itself.  Wouldn't buy this again.
