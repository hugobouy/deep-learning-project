<REVIEW>
I always thought Hillary would be the first female president. That was until I read this book. Mr. Morris does a great job providing the public with another view of Hillary Clinton that differs from the image she paints of herself in her own book. True...there is always two sides to every story, but at least now we get to see that other side. Morris provides an insight into the former first lady that we haven;t seen before in any other books about her... insight from someone that worked very close to her on a daily basis . This is worth checking out, and as usual... make your own mind up!
