<REVIEW>
My daughter slept better on this mattress the very first time that we put her down on it (and that's saying something, since she didn't want to sleep anywhere else but between us on our king size bed). It's been about 11 months since then, and she sleeps fabulously on this mattress. I can't recommend it highly enough. 
 
 I appreciate that it's organic - and that there are no harmful chemicals - and that it is still fire-resistant. 
 
 I think the coil system is far more comfortable than the foam (which she had before) - and it still provides extremely firm support. 
 
 It's pricey, yes, but the return to civilized life (a.k.a. when she started sleeping through the night) was worth just about any price. 
 
 I'm now about to buy a second one for my next baby!
