<REVIEW>
The Anita Blake series -- I cannot express enough how MUCH you need it read them if you haven't already. Let me tell you the reasons why. One, the main character, Anita is tough and modern, and she could beat the socks  off of the biggest bodyguard out there at only 5'4 (with the help of some  uzis, sawed off shotguns, and her precious firestar.)  Two, the best  contemporary science-fiction/fantasy books you'll ever find. Guns,  vampires, werewolves, and necromancers are just a walk in the park.   Three, (and I feel MOST important), might I mention that taking one look  at ANY of the male characters in this book is enough to make you stop,  drool, and forget your own name? How about that delectable French fanged  popsicle with the tight leather pants, Jean-Claude? (You can bite ME  anytime, JC!) Ahem. In any case, I recommend these books to any sane  SF/Fantasy book lover out there, because I'm afraid dissapointment is not  an option. I am 99.9% sure you will fall in hopeless love with these books  after reading them, so get a head start, eh?  Guilty Pleasures is the  first book in (so far) a series of nine. Read away, m'friends...
