<REVIEW>
Like others, I have been waiting for this game to be released since last year.  We have a Wii but my main platform choice is DS.  
 
 I have to say this Lego game is pretty good now that I have played it for a few days.  My only real complaint is that unlike the previous Lego DS games you CANNOT use the buttons on the right to perform any of the spells like you could in the Lego Star Wars and Indiana Jones games to perform stunts, punch, etc.  For this game you must use the stylus because of how the "spells" are performed. I found it a little annoying at first, but now it seems completely natural.
 
 And since you need the stylus out to do any of the spells you find it is easier to "guide" Harry or whoever around the game instead of using the directional keys to walk your character around like in the previous games.  I can see this being where the dizzy feeling can occur until you get used it.  
 
 I also agree about the sensitivity in using the stylus and either changing characters or doing the spinning stun thing in error time after time.
