<REVIEW>
As a casual reader of fiction, I admittedly purchased this book out of loyalty rather than hunger for a good fiction novel.  My loyalty was rewarded many times over.
 
 From the creative use of Kipling's poems to the eerily familiar events woven into this "love story", I loved every electronic page of it.  My Kindle lit up with the book on Tuesday and the content would not allow me stay away from this story for very long.
 
 Can't want for the next phase for Noah and Molly.
 
 Bravo Mr Beck, Bravo!
