<REVIEW>
Child slavery, mistreatment of the elderly, homoeroticism....business hugs! These topics may not inspire bouts of laughter, but they are something we haven't seen before. Pushing comedy boundaries again in their second season, Tim and Eric are even more disturbing this time around and even more creative in their second season.
 
 If you enjoyed (or hated) Season 1 this one probably won't sway your opinion either way. Besides the amazing duo of T&E you get great guest stars such as Raine Wilson, Patton Oswalt, and the incomparable John C. Reilly. (as Dr. Steven Brule)
 
 This, like T&E's previous show Tom Goes to the Mayor is guilty of polarizing comedy fans on the Adult Swim network block. It's perhaps too adult for some and is maybe too silly for others. It's a great watch if you enjoy absurd and unsettling humor, though.
