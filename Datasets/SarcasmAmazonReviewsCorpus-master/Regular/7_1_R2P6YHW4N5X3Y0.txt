<PRODUCT>Apple iPod touch 32 GB (3rd Generation) NEWEST MODEL (Electronics)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
This is my first iPod Touch and I'm enjoying every minute of it.  I previously had a iPod Nano 3rd Gen, but broke it at the gym, actually I smashed it on one of the machines.  I was debating about getting a nano or an iTouch, but I'm glad I chose the Touch.  The bad, would be no camera, battery doesn't last that long, and you require a wireless connection for some of the features.  The good, would be the buit in Wi-Fi, the tons of free apps, the easy to use interface. I recommend the 32GB or 64GB over the 8GB, the 8GB is really a 2nd Gen, not that fast when it comes to games, I got the 32GB and I can see a difference.
