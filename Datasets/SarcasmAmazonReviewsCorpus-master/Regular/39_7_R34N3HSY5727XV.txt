<REVIEW>
Believe it or not, I had never owned a powered subwoofer until I purchased the "Onkyo SWK204" after researching what I might need to complete my sound system after adding a new Panasonic Plasma HDTV,  a Sony Blu-Ray DVD, and a new Sony receiver.  After a week of listening to the SW in my home, I am thrilled with the purchase. 
 
 The "Onkyo SWK204" Bass Reflex powered subwoofer has a built in 230 watt amp which is more than adequate for the home theatre system I have installed in my large living/family room.  It is a 10" cone subwoofer that is attractive yet non intrusive in a basic black with silver cone and sturdy enough weighing in at 26 pounds.
 
 I am NOT a techie so I will only say that with so many of the new movie sound tracks containing low frequency emissions (LFE), I was astounded at the difference this SW made in my home entertainment enjoyment.  It has a frequency response of 25 Hz to 150 Hz and a continuously variable crossover (50Hz-200Hz) controlled by a cross over frequency control along with the customary volume control and a lighted standy mode.  
 
 There are certainly better and more powerful subwoofers out there and you will, of course, pay for the advanced power or features.  As a home audio/visual amateur, I found this unit to be an acceptable and efficacious choice based on performance and price.
