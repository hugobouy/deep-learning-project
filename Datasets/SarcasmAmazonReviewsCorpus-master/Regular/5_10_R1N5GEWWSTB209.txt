<REVIEW>
These gloves have turned out to be some of the best ones I've had in a while!  I'm a hot natured guy, so these work perfect on the warmer weather rides.  The air vents are perfectly placed to keep air flowing through the glove and to keep you from sweating too much against the leather.  On colder rides, they may not keep you warm enough if you're a cold natured person, but for me they're perfect!  I highly recommend these to anyone who wants to stay a little cooler during those long rides!
