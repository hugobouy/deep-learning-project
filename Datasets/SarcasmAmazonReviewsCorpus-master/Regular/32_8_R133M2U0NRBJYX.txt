<PRODUCT>Star Kids Snack & Play Travel Tray (Baby Product)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
This is a great travel tray for my 3 year old son.  We have a Britax carseat and this fits perfectly.  It is just sturdy enough that he is able to eat snacks, color, and play with his cars and other small toys.  It also keeps everything from constantly falling on the floor.  The mesh pockets on the side are also a great feature.
