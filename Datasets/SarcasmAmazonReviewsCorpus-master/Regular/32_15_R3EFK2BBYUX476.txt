<REVIEW>
I HATE THESE! TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! I HAVE A PAIR OF BEACH CLOGS THAT ARE WORN OUT AND STILL ARE BETTER THAN THESE. YOUR FEET SLIDE AROUND IN THEM. THEY DON'T CONFORM TO YOUR FEET LIKE THE BEACH CLOGS DO. THEY ARE NOT AS SOFT OR CUSHY. I HATE THEM. I SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THE "TRIED AND TRUE" INSTEAD OF TRYING SOMETHING NEW!
