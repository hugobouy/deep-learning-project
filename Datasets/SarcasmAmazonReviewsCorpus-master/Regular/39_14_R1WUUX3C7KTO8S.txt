<REVIEW>
I LOVE THIS STUFF !!!
 Its got a great lemon smell and it spreads easily, like baby oil. It's not greasy like "skin so soft" and it's natural. I never did like the smell of DEET and I always wondered what the unnatural chemicals were doing to my skin.
 
 The most important thing is IT WORKS !!!  Even after 100s of ticks are crawling and biting, one squirt and they die. I use one squirt per ear and mosquitoes stay away from my head. I oil up my arms and legs then I head off in to the bush without fear of bug bites. I spray it on any scratches because I have found that it makes a great disinfectant and wound dressing with very little sting. It's a must for any med kit.
 
 Warning: if you get it in your eyes it will sting for a few seconds until your tears dilutes the oils. It's flavor is NOT lemony.
 
 I'm 38 and I love being, and working, in the woods and brush. This is the best repellent I have found. I'm glad Amazon has it.
