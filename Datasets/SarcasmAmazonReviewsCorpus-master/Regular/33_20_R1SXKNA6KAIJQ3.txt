<REVIEW>
If you dont have a twisted sense of humor like most T&E fans then you won't like this DvD. However if you are like me and you cant get enough of this show, then you will love this DvD. The extras are hilarious (Gettin' It Dunn is a personal favorite) and of course the episodes are unforgettable. The only beef I have with this DvD is that it has no commentary. T&EASGJ! season 1 had commentary on the DvD and I loved it, season 2 and 3 don't and I wish they did. However this is still a sweet DvD so get it.
