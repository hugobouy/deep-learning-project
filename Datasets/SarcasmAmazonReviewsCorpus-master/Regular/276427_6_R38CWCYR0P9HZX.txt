<REVIEW>
First things first, you must assemble this bike yourself.  I had abit of trouble with the bike, brake positioning, gear settings, and ect.  So reading the manual and making sure everything is aligned properly is a must.  The only down side I found to this bike is weak tubes.  My advice is buy a decent pair with your order, and higher quality brakes if you live in the green mountains.
