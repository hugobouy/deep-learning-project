<REVIEW>
This book is full of lots of great information about various reading jobs.  There's only one drawback:  The most recent copyright is 1993!  That means NO information on internet use and very little on word processing, etc., in relation to the book's subject.  Bruce Fife may be retired, or perhaps even gone by now, but it would be wonderful if someone would revisit this book and update it.  I would definitely buy an updated version!!
