<REVIEW>
I really liked PuzzleQuest: Challange of the Warlords on Xbox Live Arcade, so when I got my new DSi, I bought PuzzleQuest: Galactrix to go with the system. It is a lot like the original, except in space. You mine for substances, and upgrade your spaceship, instead of improving your mount. Instead of magic, you have lasers and shields. Although, there are some psychic powers. 
 
 All-in-all the new board with the multiple angles is more challenging, and the 'jump-gate' hacking can get tense because of the time limits. I think this is a good upgrade to a great game, and it will probably chew up a similar amount of my free time as the original.
