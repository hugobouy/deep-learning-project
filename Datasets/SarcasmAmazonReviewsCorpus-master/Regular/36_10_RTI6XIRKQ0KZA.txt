<PRODUCT>Banzai Wipeout Curve Water Park (Toy)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
I was skeptical how well the curve would work on this huge slide, but with the water running it works great!  Kids fly up the wall of the curve like they were going down a water park waterslide.  It's been great for occupying the kids for hours at a time!  Definitely recommend!!
