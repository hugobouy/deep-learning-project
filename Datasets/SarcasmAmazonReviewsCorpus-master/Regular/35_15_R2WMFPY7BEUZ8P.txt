<REVIEW>
I give this book away to customers and friends all the time. In the current world of big changes coming fast this will help you look realistically at where you and how to stay successful and sane while you change. Worth the money many times over and in the audio version it's just a listen on a few trips to work that can change your perceptions on change.
