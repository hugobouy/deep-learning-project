<REVIEW>
Despite the fact that this is a "Dummies" book, it is actually quite detailed and scientific in nature.  A good review of basic facts in regards to male & female bodies, esp. for those of us who have been out of sex ed for a while now.  Also provides some thoughtful information for "beginners".  
 
 It also includes interesting extra facts & information, like sex during pregnancy, sex during menstruation, the importance of prostate & other male/female exams, interesting pros & cons of different positions, etc.
 
 Also, Dr. Ruth's personality comes through in the book, which is generally a good thing.  She adds a touch of humor to this book, though at times a bit too quirky...  
 
 Overall, a good book for the topic and probably useful for parents wanting to speak to their kids about sex (or if they are too uneasy to give them the talk directly).
