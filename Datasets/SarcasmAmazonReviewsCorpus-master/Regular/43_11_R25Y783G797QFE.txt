<REVIEW>
Ashlee Simpson is the girl who got caught lip-syncing on SNL, so her CDs must not be very good, right? 
 
 Wrong. 
 
 After all, everyone from KISS too Evanescence have admitted to using backing vocals live. But does that mean they make bad CDs? 
 
 Not at all. 
 
 Autobiography is am excellent teen-pop disk. Period. Most people will take their aggressions out on this CD since it has the name Ashlee Simpson attached to it, but that doesn't mean it doesn't contain some of the catchiest pop-rock tunes this decade.
 
 Of course, it's not for everyone. Music snobs who like "important" tunes (i.e.: Death Cab for Cutie, Radiohead, etc.) will not like this CD. It's total fluff, but it's the kind of catchy, fun fluff you can't help but blast in your car and scream along to. 
 
 (In fact, you can practically hear groups of giggling girls at a slumber party somewhere singing along with you.)
 
 Best Tracks: Autobiography, Pieces of Me, Shadow, LaLa (!!), Love Me for Me, Undiscovered
 
 Don't be embarrassed! Buy this CD and let your inner teen loose.
