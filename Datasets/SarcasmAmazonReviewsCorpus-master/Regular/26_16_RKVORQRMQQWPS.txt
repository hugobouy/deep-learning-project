<REVIEW>
British stage and screen actor Jeremy Irons is a beguiling reader whether sotto voce or thunderous declaration.  His crisply articulate delivery is especially well suited to this contemporary fable reminding us of what is truly important in life. 	Santiago, a  shepherd boy, dreams of treasure hidden in Egypt.  So, he leaves his home in Spain to search for the most precious hoard  imaginable, in other words, he follows his dream. His quest takes him to the markets of  Tangier and across the Egyptian desert to forage among the Pyramids. 	During his journey he meets a Gypsy woman, a self proclaimed king, and an Alchemist, all of whom offer Santiago directions.  Listeners do not know what the treasure is that the boy seeks, but they do learn that riches are not found in possessions but rather within our hearts and minds. 	Mr. Irons has already been lauded by his peers - he is the winner of an Emmy Award, an Academy Award, and a Tony Award.  This reading will simply add luster to his already stellar accomplishments.
