<REVIEW>
These cushion crew socks by Hanes are very well made and they keep your feet warm. I started to wear these when it's cold at night and I want to sleep with socks on my feet. These crew socks can be worn for athletic activities but they're probably more suited for everyday routine wear. 
 
 These crew length socks have a reinforced heel and toe; this makes them last longer and they still feel very comfortable on my feet. The socks only come in white; and that is a disappointment. However, these are relatively affordable yet good quality socks especially if you need white socks! 
 
 I would not dry these socks at high temperatures. These socks contain spandex, so high temperature drying would probably result in the socks becoming too loose on your feet. Eventually the fabric could loosen so much that the socks will "bunch up" almost as low as your ankles when you wear them--and that's very uncomfortable. Dry these socks at a lower temperature. Then they will remain just as comfortable as ever. 
 
 Overall, you can't go wrong buying these socks. They keep your feet extra warm during colder weather. They are manufactured so well that you definitely get more than your money's worth. Not bad at all!
