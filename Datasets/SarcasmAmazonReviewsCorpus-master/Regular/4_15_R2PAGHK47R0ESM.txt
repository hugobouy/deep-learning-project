<REVIEW>
This was a really good book. It is written in plain language and will make you think of someone you have known. It is quick read that keeps your attention till the very end. The sad thing is, it is a book about real people. Thank God there are only four of them per hundred, put they can leave a path of destruction in their wake. Being aware of who you share this world with is very important and knowing how to deal with the ones who don't seem "quite right" is a lesson well worth learning.
