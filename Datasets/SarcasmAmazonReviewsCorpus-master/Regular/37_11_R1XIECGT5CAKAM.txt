<REVIEW>
Out of all the movies that I've ever seen this past year, this is definitely one of the worst and most pathetic movies I've ever felt like I wanted to go away. Paris Hilton gives a very unconvincing performance as she tries to do whatever it takes to make her friend a better attractive woman to men. Sadly, for someone who really never learned her lessons and lied about giving back to others on Larry King Live, Paris Hilton showed no effort of changing her ways, and also showed she really doesn't have the drive to act. Not even die hard Paris Hilton fans would even come close to being interested in this movie.
