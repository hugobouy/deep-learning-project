<REVIEW>
I've read some of the other reviews concerning this printer discussing noise, print time and paper handling.  Well, here's me take.  I have had the printer for over a month now.  The printer is far quieter than the Photosmart 7550 I had before (it sounded like two monkies with hammers were working inside). The 8000 is very quiet to me.  I use a PC with the XP op system and it takes a total of 30 seconds to print anything I've printed so far.  It usually takes 12 to 14 seconds to initiallize and around 15 to 18 seconds to print the page - whether all text or partial graphics.  I've not had any paper handling issues either - though I do just use HP All Purpose paper.  I haven't tried unusual paper types.  Bottom line: if you just want a printer you can count on for everyday stuff then this is the one.
