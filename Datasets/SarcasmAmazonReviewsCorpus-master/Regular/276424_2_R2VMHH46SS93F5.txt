The songs are simply beautiful. And they do show the artists growth. The melody is pop and rock and rap, and its easy and smooth. Something to dance along with in your livingroom all alone, or with someone too.
 
 "I'm a lot more conscious than on my first few albums," says the singer. "I have a lot of kids that follow me now, so I have to be responsible to those who listen to my music. On [my debut album] Trouble, that wasn't even a concern because it was about who I was and what I been through. Now I have fans that actually look up to me and follow me, so I'm really watching the content I put on my records." 
 
 The comment from Akon is very amirable. Very cool of him to acknowledge what he knows to be true.
