<REVIEW>
Very happy to see the Enviro Steamer return !!!  I have had the 311A enviro steamer for 2 years.  I had to  pay an arm & a leg for it on ebay because Eureka discontinued this product several years ago.  Mopping was my least favorite chore, it almost brought me to tears I hated it so much.  I have over 1200 sq.ft. of tile in my house & keeping it clean used to be a daunting task.   UNTIL........the enviro steamer.
 
 One of the best purchases I have ever made.  No more bucket & mop,  no more over perfumed wet jet that leaves you with a sticky floor & expensive replacement pads & fluids.  Now it is just water, the enviro steamer, a washable & reusable magic pad & me.  I actually consider cleaning my floors FUN now.  By the way.....men love using the enviro steamer, you may even find your husband cleaning the floors more often. 
 
 Hint:  Get a few extra Magic pads, 1 or 2 is not enough unless you have only 1 small area to clean.  After I finish with 1 room, I just slap a new pad on, refill the water, give the enviro steamer a few minutes to heat back up & I'm on to the next room.  The first room is dry in minutes & clean.
