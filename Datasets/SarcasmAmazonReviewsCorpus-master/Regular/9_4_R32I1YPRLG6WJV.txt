<REVIEW>
This product is fantastic!  If you're looking for a personal die cut system I wouldn't bother with anything else on the market right now.  It is compact when closed, so it won't take up unnecessary table space.  It is also very light and has a comfortable handle for travelling.
 
 Yes, it is a bit of an investment, but it is honestly a better deal than many of the cheaper systems out there.  It can cut each shape in 11 sizes from 1 inch to 5.5 inches.  Most cartridges are around $90; compare that to quickutz & sizzix alphabets which retail for $150, can only cut one size, and take up a lot more storage space.
 
 Blades are easy to replace and the cutting mats seem to last longer than cricut suggests.  You'll get more life out of them by rotating the mat each time you cut and also storing it with the plastic sheet to keep dust from accumulating on the sticky surface.
 
 I've heard of people having difficulty cutting thicker cardstock with this machine, but we have been able to cut bazzil easily by setting the blade depth to 6 and the speed & pressure to their max settings.
 
 I've used both the Cricut and Xyron Personal Cutting System extensively and would recommend the Cricut.
