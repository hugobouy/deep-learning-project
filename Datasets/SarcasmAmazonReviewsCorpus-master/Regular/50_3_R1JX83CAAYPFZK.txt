<PRODUCT>Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter (Kitchen)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
I recieved this filter with my Keurig B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System  for Christmas this year, so I cannot review its durability.  I have some worries based on the previous reviews, but I'll hope for the best.  As far as the coffee this makes, it is great.  Of course, it greatly depends on the coffee you use.  The coffee I find myself using most in the filter is Peet's Major Dickason's Blend, but I've tried many others and they are all superb.  It is hard to believe, but this produces a cup of coffee just as good as a K-Cup.  It is nice to be able to fill it to the very top to get a nice strong cup, as well as use coffees not available in K Cups.  It also saves a lot of money.  I try to use this more than K Cups and that will keep the expense of K Cups low enough for me.  Note: Many reviews specify a type of grind, but I find that a medium grind that you would find in a bag of pre-ground works great.  Also, filling it to the top leaving a little room works best for me.  If this lasts a reasonable amount of time, it is
 certainly worth the price to replace it.  UPDATE: I have already reviewed this product.  I got it this Christmas with a Keurig B40.  I got a "good" my k cup.  I was worried by the bad reviews about it breaking.  Clearly, some of these are made faulty.  I found this when i bought a second so I wouldn't have to wash the first over and over.  I got a "bad" one.  These filters are great, unless you get a bad one.  Before you use your new filter, make sure that the top EASILY tightens onto the filter.  If it does, you have a good one.  If it is difficult, return it go get another.  If your are buying in store, check first.  If you own a Keurig, you need one of these, but make sure you get the right one!  (UPDATE: 6 months later; the filter still works great, but I have found that only coarsely ground coffee will work without it getting clogged.  If you are using medium/fine ground coffee and it gets clogged, leaving you with little coffee, use coarsely ground.  It took me a while to figure this out.  Now it works every time.
