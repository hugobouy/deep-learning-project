<REVIEW>
I had little hope for great reception from this portable TV, I live in the country 50 miles from the transmitter towers.  Analog reception is poor, but digital reception is amazing.  Most of the stations are transmitting in digital and I get them all, although I most use the external antenna and it is very directional sensitive.  The picture is as sharp as my digital cable connected LCD and sound quality is also excellent for the size of the speakers.  The remote does not have a power or volume control functions which would be nice.  On battery power it operates about two hours.  I am so pleased with this TV and may buy another one for my office.
