<PRODUCT>Belkin Neoprene Kindle Case (Fits 6" Display, Latest Generation Kindle) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging] (Accessory)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
The Belkin sleeve does what its supposed to do, which is protect my Kindle 2.  Nothing fancy about it.  I wasnt a fan of the original Kindle's case so I opted for something that it just slides in and out of.
