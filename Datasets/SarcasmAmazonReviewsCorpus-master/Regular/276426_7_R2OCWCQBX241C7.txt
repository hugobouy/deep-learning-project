<REVIEW>
I highly recommend this book to anyone who is searching for answers to Life, the Universe and Everything (with apologies to Douglas Adams - read that one too!). Written with passion and insight it makes compelling reading. If you are an independent thinker, a quester for answers to the origin of the human race and one who has an open mind about the effect that mythology (religion) has had on human history, you will find this book enthralling. This book should appeal to atheists because it tells them that they no longer have to put up with mythologies foisting their views on them and they should be confident and proud to be an independent thinker. The book should also be read by creationists because how can you condemn it if you haven't read it? (Notice how many people condemn evolution without ever having opened a book of Darwin's and yet non adherents to mythology seem to have read many of the great mythological works such as the Bible). Read it. It may change your life. You won't regret it.
