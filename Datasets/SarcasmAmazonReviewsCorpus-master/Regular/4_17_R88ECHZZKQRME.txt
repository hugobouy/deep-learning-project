<PRODUCT>Transcend 8 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC6 (Electronics)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
I wanted to take advantage of the video capability on the Canon SD800IS digital camera and required a large memory card. Given the way memory requirements increase over time I opted for the largest available. I also wanted a fast memory write speed. The Transcend 8Gb SDHC Class 6 card was the best value available.
 So far this card has worked flawlessly.
