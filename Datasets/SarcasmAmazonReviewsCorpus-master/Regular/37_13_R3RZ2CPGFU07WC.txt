 After researching the `cornucopia' of compressors on the market and concluding my own specific needs for such, I decided to purchase this compressor.  Good call on my part.
 
 After following CH instructions on pre-operation setup, this compressor has performed very well.  Within the first 24-hours of receiving it, I used it to add air to vehicle and ATV tires to cleaning the air filter and deck on my mower, to blowing off steps prior to painting.
 
 While the coiled air hose takes a little time to get accustomed to, I consider it a minor inconvenience.  As many have reported, one may consider the noise level extreme.  While you can expect noise from any such device, this inconvenience is limited to only when the device is charging.
   
 The portability is a nice added bonus.  If you must use an extension cord, make sure the cord is properly rated to the amps and watts of the device.  Otherwise, circuit breakers can trip and the device will not work as designed. The use of household-type light duty extension cords may lead to electrical shock hazard, increased fire hazard, and damage to your new compressor.  When in doubt, consult with a licensed electrician.
 
 Overall, I rate the compressor 5 stars. It beats driving to a service station and throwing away [...] for three minutes of air time. Assuming you can find a service station with a working air hose!
