<REVIEW>
Avril Lavigne has changed a lot, in my opinion, since "Let Go".  But I think those changes were made for the better.  Not only do her songs have less cheesy lines in them, but you can tell just by looking at her that she is more mature.  I found this album to be a little depressing because there aren't too many cheerful, upbeat songs like there were on Let Go, but still a cool pop/rock album!  Here are my ratings for each song:
 
 1. Take Me Away-5/5.  This song has a hard rock beat, and is somewhat like "Losing Grip", the song that started off Let Go.  It is about just wanting to get away from all the pain and suffering being felt inside.
 
 2. Together-4/5.  Avril's vocals in the chorus have a rather annoingly high pitch, but this song is still a good one.  In this song, Avril talks about not feeling "together" with her boyfriend. 
 
 3. Don't Tell Me-5/5.  One of my favorite songs on this album.  It has a rather mature subject, and is not exactly the most appropriate for younger kids.  
 
 4. He Wasn't-3/5.  The "Sk8r Boi" of Under My Skin, "He Wasn't" is really upbeat, and the lyrics are kind of cheesy in some parts.  In this song, Avril sings about the boy she likes turning out to be someone completely different from what she thought he would be.
 
 5. How Does It Feel-3/5.  This song is slow, but Avril's vocals sound pretty good in it.  That's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2.  It is about wondering how other people view the world.
 
 6. My Happy Ending-5/5.  Another of my favorites on this album.  It has a great beat, and catchy lyrics.  It is about an "UN-Happy Ending" with a boy.  Note that there is a kind of big cussword in the part after the first chorus.
 
 7. Nobody's Home-4/5.  I guess this is the song I should be talking about the most, since Amazon won't let you listen to a clip of it on this album.  It is a kind of sad song about a girl who's been misguided, and who is alone and depressed.  The beat is good, and Avril's voice sounds nice. 
 
 8. Forgotten-5/5.  This song starts out in an eerie sort of way, then turns into hard rock and loud vocals.  This is yet another of my favorite songs.  It is about, of course, being forgotten and left behind.
 
 9. Who Knows-3/5.  This song has a good beat, and is about making your dreams come true.
 
 10. Fall To Pieces-3/5.  This song is slightly better then "Who Knows", in my opinion, although it sounds rather similar to it.  It is a love song, and Avril's vocals sound pretty good in it.
 
 11. Freak Out-5/5.  This song sounds like one that would end a really good movie, or be the favorite on the movie soundtrack.  It has a good beat, and catchy lyrics.  I used to not like it, but yes, it is now ANOTHER of my favorite songs on this album.  It is about letting loose.
 
 12. Slipped Away-5/5.  This is a sad song Avril wrote about when her grandpa died.  The beat is nice, though slow, the lyrics are good, and Avril's vocals sound great.  If you're easily depressed/disturbed then you might not like this song, though.
 
 By averaging, I got the overall rating of 4 stars for this album, which is better then the overall rating I got for Let Go.  I would suggest listening to clips of the songs here on Amazon before purchasing, though.
