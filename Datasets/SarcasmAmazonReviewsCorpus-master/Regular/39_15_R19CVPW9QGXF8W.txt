<REVIEW>
This product works better than any other cleaning method I have used. The cleaning fluid is of high quality but the real gem is the microfiber cleaning cloth that is included. By using this system all of your displays will be crystal clean all the time. I tried it on plasma, LCD & even my camera lcd display & they never looked better. Highly recommended product for keeping very expensive displays looking great.
