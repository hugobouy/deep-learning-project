<REVIEW>
At the time I purchased this pedometer I also bought one that counted steps only.  Measuring steps only, one cannot relate those numbers to anything meainingful; whereas the multifunction meter gives you actual milage readings.  It also equates that reading to calories burned which I find very helpful as a gauge for the effectiveness of my walking exercise. I intend to purchase additional units of this model.
