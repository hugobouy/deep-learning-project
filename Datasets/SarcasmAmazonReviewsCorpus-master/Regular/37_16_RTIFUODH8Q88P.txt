<PRODUCT>JVC HANC250 High-Grade Noise-Cancelling Headphones (Electronics)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
I just received my JVC HANC250 headphones and I have to say AMEN!  I had previously ordered the Sony MDR-NC60 headphones and sent them back within 10 minutes due to a very annoying humming/vibration in the right ear cup.  Booo!
 
 The JVC headphones are super comfortable (I'm about to take a 14 hour flight next week and I'll update after that) and the sound is amazing.  My partner has the Bose QC3 headphones and I have to say these sound just as good if not better and they are less than half the price; the QC3 sound a little "muddy" on the lows.
 
 The other great feature is the AAA battery used to power them and the hard case that comes for storage (great for packing in luggage).  No need to worry about having a plug on the airplane when your battery dies (just be sure to pack an extra AAA). 
 
 If you are in the market for noise cancelling headphones, do yourself a favor and give these a listen.  I don't think you will be disappointed.
