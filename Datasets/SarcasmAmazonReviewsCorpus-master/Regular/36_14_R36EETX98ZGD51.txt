<REVIEW>
I have fair colored skin. I applied the lotion once daily as directed for a week and had almost no results. The last 2 days I've been applying it twice daily and still almost no results. I'm not satified.
 
 I just purchased the medium/tan skin tone one and am hoping that does the trick. 
 
 On the positive side, it smells good (in my opinion) and works well as a moitsurizer. My goal though, is to have a natual looking tanned face.
