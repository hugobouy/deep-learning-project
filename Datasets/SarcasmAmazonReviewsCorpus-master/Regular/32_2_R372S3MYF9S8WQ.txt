<REVIEW>
I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella and normally love her books under the name of Madeline Wickham, too.  This book, however, drove me nuts!  I only made it about 1/4 of the way through before I returned it to the store - luckily I hadn't cracked the spine, and they took it back and refunded my money.  This book is so terrible that I couldn't even make it past the first 1/4 of it - the characters were horrible, shallow people, and the plot is so see-through.  Clearly, this book is one of Sophie's earlier works - the "plot" is terrible.  Don't waste your money - don't take a chance in case you crack the spine - you won't be able to return it!  Spend your money on one of Sophie Kinsella's novels instead - "Remember Me" is hysterical and a great, easy read.  "Cocktails for 3" is painful trash.
