<REVIEW>
It is easy to understand why all the reviews here are either five stars or one star.  There is no middle ground here.  This book is wonderfully written and contains very little rehashed material which at this point is very hard to do.  The best part is the critical analysis of Hillary's past  writings and how they expose a hidden political agenda.  Olson's analysis  of the First Lady's seemingly unaltered radical persuasion is convincingly  demonstrated in this meticulously  researched biography. This type of writing  is not one star.  One star is like trying to bury the many insights  which this book magnificently exposes.  Bravo Barbara!
