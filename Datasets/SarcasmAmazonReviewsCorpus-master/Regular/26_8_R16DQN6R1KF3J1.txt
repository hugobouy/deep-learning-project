<REVIEW>
This is an excellent buckwheat honey - and tastes exactly the way buckwheat honey supposed to taste. It is a bit tart, even a little bitter, not too sweet.   If you are from Eastern Europe or like Eastern European cuisine, you will really appreciate this honey. It is very dark and has that strong noble taste and smell I associate with good quality honey.
 
 If you like sugary sweet clover or alfalfa honey (bright yellow substance that does not crystallize, which chain supermarkets sell in plastic bottles), this honey is not for you.
