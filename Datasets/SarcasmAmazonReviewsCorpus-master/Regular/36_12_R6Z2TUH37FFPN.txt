<REVIEW>
I bought this broom from a local  hardware store some years ago.  It is so great that I decided to get another one for my house in the South.  Everybody should have a broom like this.  I use it with bleach and everything else.  It just doesn't wear out. (Unfortunately,, the handle got lost in the mail and I will be ordering another one).
