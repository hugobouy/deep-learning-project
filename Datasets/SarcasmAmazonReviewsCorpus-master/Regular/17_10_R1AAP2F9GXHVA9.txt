First, I'm not sure what the abundance of U-238 is in this sample. In any case, if you want this for "experimenting," note that this is NOT the U-235 that you probably should be looking for. If this sample is pure, even though it's just U-238, it deserves 4 stars. But only 3 for now, since no information is provided here.
