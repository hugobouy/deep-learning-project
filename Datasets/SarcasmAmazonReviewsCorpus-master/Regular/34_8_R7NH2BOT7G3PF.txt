<REVIEW>
I read Can You Keep a Secret in about one day, and I really enjoyed it. I found Emma to be a good character- one that I actually enjoyed more than Becky from the Shopaholic series. Becky always made me cringe because of her actions (I can't watch movies like that either), but Emma had a good, solid head on her. I laughed out loud at Emma's actions, and really empathized with her, whereas I always wanted to sit Becky down and give her a good talking to. The plot was a tad predictable, but so were all the Shopoholic books, and that didn't stop me either! I really enjoy British chic-lit (it's my guilty pleasure), and I hope that Sophie Kinsella keeps writing fun books with engaging characters.
