<REVIEW>
I think some products like this work differently for some people. My teeth did not have coffee or cig stains so I wasnt trying to remove stains. They just are turning yellow as I age. I did see a difference but it wasnt a dramatic difference. More like a slight improvement. I hope to use the 3rd vial of gel to improve the results soon. I was hoping for a bright white smile I see other people have but I guess that might only be optained by a visit to the dentist. I have tried the colgate brush on gel and the crest strips. I would say this is the best results of the 3 products. It might be more about my teeth than the product though.
