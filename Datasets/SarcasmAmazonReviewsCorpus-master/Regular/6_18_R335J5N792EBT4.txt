<REVIEW>
I love this pedometer! It is the most accurate pedometer that I have ever had. I tested it on my treadmill and when I walk. I have put it on my belt loop and also in my pants pocket and it works great! I like the feature at 12:00pm it resets itself back to zero. I would highly reccommend it, worth the money!
