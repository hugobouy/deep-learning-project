<REVIEW>
The post-apocalypse sub-genre of science fiction has always been a place I like to go.  I'll give movies of this type some slack I wouldn't always give other kinds, so that even a relatively weak post-apoc flick like Doomsday (in which Malcolm McDowell appeared, as he does here) still has its interesting moments. But if it's a good one such as I Am Legend, I'm really into it bigtime.  So I've been eagerly anticipating The Book of Eli from the time the first trailers appeared, and now that I've seen it there were many things about it I liked.  Start with the mythic prophet main character.  His super-heroic weapons skills showed there was something unique about him early on.  Those scenes were generally pretty cool, and they were spread out pretty well over the length of the film.  (Any more fight scenes would have bored me.)  Eli's story plays out with a kind of grim determinism, although it also has hopeful elements as well.  I was glad I wasn't previously familiar with the story, as the major revelations about the Book in the final act were a complete surprise.   Mr. Washington was an excellent choice for the lead.  Other roles were well cast too, including (to my surprise) Jennifer Beals as the blind mistress of Gary Oldman's bad boss character.  Oldman himself struck just the right notes of ego, madness & desperation.   Anyway, as far as the post-apoc nature of the movie, it provides fascinating glimpses of which possessions would be really valuable in such a world (ex., chapstick yes; cigarette lighter, not so much), and other aspects of survival felt very authentic throughout the film.  All in all, it wasn't quite the adventure I was expecting (with occasional pacing issues), but I still found it to be an enjoyable viewing experience.
