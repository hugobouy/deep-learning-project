"If what I say is so outrageous, why don't they quote me accurately?"
 - page 80 (Hardback edition)
 
 Since she burst on the political commentary scene in 1996, Ann Coulter has been both adored and hated for her sarcastic conservative comments. With no attempt being made to hide her right-wing bias, she is unashamedly blunt about her views, often coating them in biting repartee. It seems that each time Coulter opens her mouth (or posts another column on her website), the mainstream media screams that she's "done it this time!" Yet her books are bestsellers, and she continues to be published. As she points out, if she's so over-the-top, why are people continuing to read her work? 
 
 In her sixth book, "If Democrats Had Any Brains, They'd Be Republicans," Ann assembles a collection of her most famous quotes, columns, and interviews on subjects from airport security to taxes, and everything in between. Each chapter contains a brief commentary on the subject, followed by a collection of dated quotes illustrating her beliefs and opinions. 
 
 I must admit that, in the past, I have stayed away from political non-fiction. As a conservative Republican, I have found much of it to be in disagreement with my personal views on matters, and I like reading as a way to escape the seriousness of my everyday life. But as I thumbed through a copy of this book at Borders a week ago, I knew I had to read it. Coulter's wit and humor make the book a fast read, and her comments are intelligent enough to get you thinking while funny enough to make you laugh. And, while I can't say that I agree with her viewpoints on everything, I agree enough to have made this book worth my time.
 
 If you are not a conservative, do not agree with Ann's points of view, or are a liberal Democrat, then you probably will not enjoy this book. If, however, you do enjoy reading an intelligent yet witty commentary on the current state of political affairs in the United States (with an admittedly right-wing voice), this book is for you.
