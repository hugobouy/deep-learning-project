<REVIEW>
First of all, I just want to say that this watch looks great on the wrist, and it has a decent size. I like all of the features provided on this watch.  First of all, the Altimeter, Barometer, and Compass are amongst the favorite of my features.  The Barometer can be extremely accurate, along with the compass. Sometimes the Altimeter can be off measurement, but you can adjust that.  I've been wearing this watch for several days now and I plan to never take it off.  It just has features that blow every other watch I have in my collection away.  I always use the stopwatch and countdown timers on any digital that I have and this one adds ABC features on top of those as well; world time, atomic time keeping, and solar power, and 100 meter water resistance are all just pluses in an already feature laden time piece.  Not to mention the sunrise and sunset time's feature, which is really useful for maximizing the use of one day.  All in All, I give this watch five stars from a dramatic improvement on Casio's part from the PAW-1300.
 
 Update 6/22/10 *.*.*.*:
 
 As per other reviews, after owning the watch for a couple of months, I agree that the rubber strap is very uncomfortable.  Not so much the strap itself, but the little rubber wings do tend to pull wrist hair.  This watch however, does accept one piece nylon straps (22mm is correct measurement) without strap adapters; just rip off the old rubber strap and wings and replace.  I myself have changed the strap to an old 21mm nylon strap laying around in my drawer and the watch is way more comfortable.  All in all, a very accurate timepiece; with a simple swap of the band, the watch has become more comfortable to wear.
