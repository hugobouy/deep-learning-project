<REVIEW>
When I first put this album on my wish list, it was something I would have liked to have, but not something that I necessarily needed.  When I first listened to it I said, "Oh this is good." I didnt listen to the whole album at once.  I heard "Undisclosed Desires" and decided I really liked that song, but nothing else really stood out.  Then when I listened further  on in the album, I heard "Exogenesis Part I." I felt like I had been knocked to the floor and my soul had been ripped out; a sign of a really good song for me. I don't know how else to describe this piece of music.  It's not a song, no not at all, it is a piece of music.  The orchestration and the singing are so hauntingly beautiful and full of emotion I just want to put on headphones, crank up the volume and let the music wash over me, painting pictures in my head.  This is what I like to do when I hear a great piece of music, song or album.
 
 After hearing that piece, I decided to read the lyrics.  When I read the 1984 themed-lyrics and listened to the album once again, I realized that "Resistence" is a Rock Opera.  All of the songs align together in a common Totalitarian-Theme: when he meets the woman he is sneaking around with before the thought police can find them, the Exogenesis Cycle wondering how and when will this world end, "the United States of Euroasia" with its a "Queen-like" anthem in it with a Chopin Nocturne with bombs going off in the background. It is incredible, and even more incredible that Matthew Bellamy is playing the classical piano like a maestro, sticks a Saint Saens excerpt in the middle of "I belong to you", and can sing an impressive Falsetto in "Exogenis Part I."  If you listen to the album as a whole, it will tell you a story, and you realize that you can't just listen to one song.
 
 This album is not like any Radiohead that i have ever heard, and in fact that is why I didn't like Muse back around 1999-2000 when they were first coming out. I thought that they were trying to mimic Radiohead, and being a Rabbid Radiohead fan that I am, I didn't want to buy any of their albums.  That is until I heard the song Supermassive Black Hole.  This album doesn't sound like Radiohead, and I think this is Muse's new voice in the music world; it shows they are serious musicians and ready to come into their own.  Screw it if it isn't radio-friendly.  If that's what you care about then don't buy this cd because it is not just a Fluff listen while you are doing something else.
 
 Listen to this album and read the lyrics. I love 1984, and this is about the best rendition or homage I have heard or seen.  Crack open a bottle of wine, take out your headphones, light a candle and lay back and enjoy. I haven't stopped
