<PRODUCT>Bio Spot Spot On Flea & Tick Control for Dogs Over 60 lbs, 6 Pack (Misc.)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
This product has worked well for me for years on 2 dogs.  I have never had a problem with fleas or ticks while using this.  It is substantially cheaper than advantage or frontline but it works just as good if not better.  The only downside is the citrusy smell that lasts 24-48 hours.
