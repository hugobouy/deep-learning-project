<REVIEW>
i havent had a dropped call yet, the reception is good, includes the bluetooth feature and you can transfer ringtones, pictures and wallpapers from your bluetooth to the phone. this is the first phone from tracfone that allows you to do this, and the camera takes ok pictures but not the best quality, it does not have a flash. the internet browser works but tracfone has crippled it so it will only let you go to the tracfone sites and will not let you go on any other url such as [...]. overall if you just want a phone for emergencies or occasional use and really dont require the many features then this is the phone for you.
