<REVIEW>
This book spans Hillary Clinton's entire life up to her election to the senate as a representative from New York.It is packed full of information and is very educational. Her writing style is excellent as is her sense of humour. 
 Mention is made of her parents and grandparents and her meeting with Bill Clinton. She speaks extensively of her life in the white house. Jackie Kennedy was an invaluable source of wisdon, advice and support to her at this time.She speaks in great detail of the opposition to health care, which was very well financed. She does not hesitate to expose her enemies. She has traveled frequently and extensively and scorns those members of congress who proundly announce they have never traveled outside the country. She feels that instead of being insular and uninformed Americans benefit from learning more about the world in which we live. Right on! I say. But she doesn't just visit an incredible number of countries,she is aware of the issues being dealt with in those places and in many instances has formed great ties with the people.
 When the s--- hit the fan with Bill and Monica Lewinsky, Hillary does not shy away from it. It took her a while and good counseling to decide whether to fight for her husband and marriage but she resolved to fight for her president.
 I think this book is a great campaign startegy for the presidency. She mentions her interest in guarding the social safety net. Her vast experience is impressive. Last but not least credit must be given to both Hillary and Bill for the raising of a well adjusted, independent and intelligent daughter. Bravo!
