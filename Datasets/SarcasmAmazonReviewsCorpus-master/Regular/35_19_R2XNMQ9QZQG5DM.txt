<REVIEW>
I agree with the other review...this works GREAT! My upper arms have become more and more flabby over the years, and within just a few weeks, I see a shocking improvement. I also do the 6 minute workout daily (because of the positive results, I am very motivated to keep doing it), and mostly while watching tv, since it's an easy routine to remember. I also take it on vacation with me, since it doesn't take up that much room. I've seen the absurd comments about it being suggestive, but honestly, don't most excercises look silly when you're doing them? This works great, and I was convince to buy it because the main site offers to not only return the purchase and shipping price, but pay for return shipping if you wanted to return it.
