<REVIEW>
People are finally realizing what I have known for years from watching "Knight Rider." David Hasselhoff can sing! Since the days of "Knight Rider," I thought David should record an album. It wasn't until the 1990's, during a publicized Pay Per View event that I realized Hasselhoff was doing just that. He had a second career as a singer, over seas! If you can find it, "Looking for Freedom," is an electerically charged album that is a must have for any David Hasselhoff fan. This album is not his best but it is definately above average.  Some of my favorite tracks on the album are: Looking for Freedom Flying on the Wings of Tenderness Lonley is the Night Sheltered Heart  song of the Night Being that Hasselhoff made his mark as a singer over seas. Most of his music is marked as an import and can be hard to find. If you are looking for more music David Hasselhoff Amazon.com is the place to come. without their help I would not have found this album.
