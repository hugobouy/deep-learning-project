<REVIEW>
Who would buy this piece of trash?
 
 Because, if you hadn't already noticed, it now comes in SLEEVELESS format. 
 
 Sleeves are for wimps. 
 
 Please, do yourself a favor and grow a pair and surf on over to the sleeveless offering now. 
 
 Because in order to do TRUE collatoral damage, you must have the guns exposed.
 
 KAPOW!
