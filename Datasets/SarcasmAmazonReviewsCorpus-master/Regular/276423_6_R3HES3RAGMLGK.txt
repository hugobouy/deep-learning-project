<REVIEW>
The best Verizon phone available as of 4-14-2010.  Runs the Eris and all other models into the ground.  The phone is heavy, and the original backs of the phones were problematic.  That is about the only cons that come to mind.  App development has made a LEAP since I originally purchased the phone on launch date.  Gaming in particular has really come into it's own.  A lot of developers have given their approval, and starting to duplicate if not migrate their apps from the Iphone.  I have 0 regrets in purchasing this phone, and I'm really hard to please.  I am a bit biased as I insist on having a physical keyboard.  Blackberry is nice in the fact you don't have to slide to access the keyboard, but the resolution and functionality more then makes up for it.  This thing does 100x the functions of my old Blackberry.
