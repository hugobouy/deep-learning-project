<REVIEW>
As if there weren't enough reviews of this book, I'll add mine: In a word,  wonderful. The &quot;protagonist&quot; is one Ignatius J. Reilly, a fat,  pompus windbag who is over-educated, but refuses to work, preferring to  stay home and drive his mother nuts while writing his never-ending treastie  on the awfulness of the modern world -- &quot;modern&quot; meaning anything  since early Medieval times! Thanks to his mother running into a building  while under the influence, Ignacious has to go to work. You can just about  imagine the kind of worker he is, versus the kind of worker he really is!  You wouldn't want to leave this guy alone with a typewriter, or even a  hot-dog cart, for a minute.  John Kennedy Toole does not just depict  Ignatius's delusions, but brilliantly depicts everyone else's delusions,  too. His novel shows us that none of us operate in a concrete reality --  our perceptions are deluded because of our beliefs, worldview, past  experiences, etc. This book should be assigned, or at least recommended,  reading for any college course dealing with post-Modern thought.
