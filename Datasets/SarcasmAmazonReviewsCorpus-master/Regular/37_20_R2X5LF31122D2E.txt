<REVIEW>
I've always been a huge Nora Roberts fan but lately her books, and especially this series, have been lacking... and at these prices I expect a good story!
 
 The characters all feel familiar, the dialogue seems repetitive and the stories lack tension. This book in particular was a difficult read since nothing really happens and the main characters were bland, annoying and have no passion. I had to force myself to finish since mid-way through the book I just didn't care about them or the other too perfect couples.
