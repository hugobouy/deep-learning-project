<REVIEW>
One Tree Hill - The Complete Sixth Season is arguably the best season of this much-loved drama. Season 5 really caught my attention last year, I have to admit I never cared for this show when these characters were in high school, the storylines were over-the-top but now I enjoy the maturity. I have recently gone back and watched the previous seasons and I still don't care for all the hoopla - Season 6 is just brilliant so start here and work your way back. Sophia Bush's character Brooke Davis really got to shine this season, she took in Sam, a wise beyond her years teenage girl - fell in love with Peyton's ex Julian and made amends with her emotionally distant mother. The season finale seemed like a series finale but I heard the show will back next season. This prime time soap is a guilty pleasure and I am proud of it!
