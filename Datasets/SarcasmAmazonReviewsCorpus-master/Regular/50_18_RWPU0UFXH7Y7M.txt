<PRODUCT>Paper Tearing Rulers 12: Deckle Edge (Kitchen)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
This is a great tool.  Simple to use, has two sides, one fine, and the other larger teeth.  Its metal and a bright color so not easy to lose or break.  It gives my watercolor paper the look of deckled edges on all four sides which works for me in framing my work and giving it that professional look.
