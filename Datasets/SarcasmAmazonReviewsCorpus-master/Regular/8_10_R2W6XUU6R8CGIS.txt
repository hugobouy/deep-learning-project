<PRODUCT>The Classic Cremation Urn. Hand Engraved Solid Brass With Black Lacquer Coat. 10" Height, Includes Velvet Storage & Display Box. (Kitchen)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
This urn is beautiful and very well made. The etching is detailed and accurate with a smooth finish. The inside is a bit rough with a powdery substance (possible a residue) but does not affect the function. The lid screws with brass threading and is a very tight secure fit. I recommend it.
