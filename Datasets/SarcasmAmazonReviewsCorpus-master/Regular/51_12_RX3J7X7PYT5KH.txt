<REVIEW>
THIS THING IS AWESOME.  I AM NEVER SHAVING AGAIN. I just used it for the first time and have decided that I will never use a razor again.  I am a guy who never likes to shave, I maintain the "few days of stubble" look throughout the week, and dread the day when I have to go through the hassle of lathering up & shaving.  But this thing is so easy to use and it just cuts you down to whatever stubble-level you want in like 2 minutes!!!! PLUS it's got this vacuum-device on it that sucks up the stray hairs into a special chamber, which you then pull out and empty when you're done trimming.   so to quote Wayne's World..."It SUCKS as it CUTS!"  I LOVE IT!! I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS TRIMMER!  I have never written a review for Amazon before and I've been shopping here for years! That's how fired up I am about my new purchase!!!!
