<REVIEW>
I love my helmet. It looks awesome and feels solid. I like that it has a padded protection that covers the ears and back of the neck that can be taken off by unzipping. There's also a detachable visor that snaps on the front. I use it for when I ride my moped and if I tilt my head down, it cuts the wind so it's not blowing as much in my eyes and face. It's very comfortable and not too heavy. It fits perfectly in the storage compartment under my moped seat, which is great if you don't want it to get stolen or have to carry it wherever you're going.
