<PRODUCT>Air Compression Leg Massager (Health and Beauty)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
One can pay $300 or more for these compression leg massagers, so this one is reasonably priced.  It is probably on the primitive side for these items - you can press up or down for the length of time, but you only figure out what this means through trial and error.  More expensive models have timers, while this one does not.  But it does inflate the chambers that go around your legs, so from that perspective it is perfectly adequate.
