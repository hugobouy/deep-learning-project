<PRODUCT>DaVinci Kalani Convertible Baby Crib - Cherry (Baby Product)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
I was on the fence about spending $600 on a solid crib or this one.  I finally decided on this one because as it turned out, the expensive Sorelle also used cam-locks on most of their cribs.  So that was the deal breaker.  The Kalani is sturdy despite the few cam-locks.  Grandpa had no problem with the assembly and finished within an hour.  This is for my 3rd child as I converted the old one already.  Features that were hard to find in one crib but offered in this one:
 
 1. rich cherry finish that complements other cherry furniture in the baby's room.
 
 2. heavy and sturdy
 
 3. 4 height settings.  Perfect for a shorty like me to easily set down a sleepy baby.  most cribs only offer 3 settings that are either too far apart or does not make much of a difference.
 
 4.  mattress springs.  i don't like slats or MDF panel to support my bouncing baby boy.  slats are a pain to adjust and MDP could slip and slide around.
 
 5. toddler rail is included, which saves a hundred bucks.
 
 6. converts to a head and footboard sleigh bed.  
 
 Cons:
 Nothing for the crib.  But I would not spend $$ on the furniture accessories from DaVinci.  $400 bucks for baby size dressers?  MDF and cheaply made?  I would recommend going to a furniture store and purchase a real dresser for less or at least comparable that will outlast the crib stage.  I have Broyhill dresser, chest, and nightstand for his room that matches the crib and I know will last after he's done with the crib (off to college and converted back to a guest room).
 
 Another recommendation: 
 corner changing table in cherry.  I don't recall the brand but the color match is great and can be used as a credenza once potty trained.  fits nicely in a corner, does not take up much space.  I don't like the DaVinci changing table as it looks silly to use it as anything else with that immovable side rail.
 
 Crib bumper: PBkids- super thick and 'cushiony' or RHbabyandchild- cover removes for easy washing.
 
 I'll post a photo once all the decor is up.  So, good luck and congrats on the new baby!
