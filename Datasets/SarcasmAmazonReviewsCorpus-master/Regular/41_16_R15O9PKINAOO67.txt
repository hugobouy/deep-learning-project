<REVIEW>
so I had to give it a read.  Actually quite a fun book - some unexpected things - not completely predictable.  A little obvious in it's moralizing, but not in an overbearing way.  Worth the time when you want to be entertained.  Some good turns-of-phrase and characters you can care about, and the story clips along at a good pace.
