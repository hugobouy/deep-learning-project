<REVIEW>
I returned the Swing and Lock gates and got this one. I am not disappointed. It was worth the additional cost. It comes with its own tool, which fastens the pressure mounts securely. I did not need an extension, so I cannot comment on how sturdy it is using those.It is very easy  to open and close, and the gate swings in both directions. It was also easy to install. I have no complaints. I can't believe how many people report bad experienced using these on stairs. If you read the directions, it is NOT to be used on stairs. If your child gets hurt, you have nobody else to blame but yourself! This gate is NOT for everyone. The opening is only 18&quot; wide, so this would not be for a home with a wheelchair. Although it installs easily, I wouldn't suggest this one if you plan on moving it from doorway to doorway on a regular basis. It takes a few minutes, not something I'd want to do all day. But it is very easy to move, such as if you where having a party or needed to move furniture. This gate is well made, but I do have one concern about durability. It has a plastic pin that locks the swinging part into place. I wonder if someone who does not push the pedal enough and pushes the gate, probably an unfamiliar adult or older child, could break it. I haven't seen anything to that affect in other reviews, so maybe not. Still, I'd have prefered to see metal. Maybe that concern is unfounded, I guess we'll see. Buy this gate.
