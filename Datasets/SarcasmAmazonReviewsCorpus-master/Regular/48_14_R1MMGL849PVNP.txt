<REVIEW>
Baby Buttercreme is fantastic. In our house, we have four different hair textures. My husband has slightly coarse, wavy hair, my eldest son has loose soft curls, I have soft and tightly coily hair, and my baby has very tightly coiled and coarse hair. Baby Buttercreme is an effective moisturizer for all of us. Believe me, I have tried a ton of less expensive alternatives and none come close.
