<REVIEW>
Let me say, I LOVE the "Twilight" books.  Like, REALLY LOVE them.  I love to read, and I usually read the classics.  I'm a Jane Austen, Elizabeth Gaskell, Bronte Sisters kind of girl.  My friend insisted for two years that I should read "Twilight", but I kept thinking, "Teen vampire romance?  Not my kind of book."  Finally, this 29-year-old mother of three was on a flight by myself with some time to read, so I bought "Twilight".  I absolutely DEVOURED it--I read one book a day until I had finished the entire saga in four days. Luckily, "Breaking Dawn" had just been released, so I didn't have to wait.  The "Twilight" books are my absolute FAVORITE guilty pleasure--I love the fluff, the cheesy dialogue, the LOVE--all of it.
 
 For me, "New Moon" really needed to redeem all that was wrong with the "Twilight" movie.  After watching "Twilight" last year, I was SO disappointed.  Catherine Hardwicke had just taken our beloved series and turned it into a made-for-TV movie.  I laughed at all of the wrong places.  How Bella and Edward fell in love was completely rushed.  I could go on.  Melissa Rosenberg butchered the book and everything that made me obsessed with it.  Sure, "Twilight" was fun to watch because it was "Twilight", but the portrayal was so, so, so wrong on so many levels.  My favorite book had been reduced to lines like "spider monkey."
 
 WELL, "NEW MOON" JUST MADE UP FOR EVERY CATHERINE-HARDWICKE WRONG!  FANS OF THE BOOK WILL ADORE THIS MOVIE.  Edward actually smiles!  The acting was SO much better, the visuals were stunning, and the dialogue was much, much improved over "Twilight".  I honestly didn't want it to end.  It stayed so true to the book we all love, and the little additions were perfect.  I really felt like I was watching Bella on screen--Kristen Stewart was spot on.  Every expression, every sad word was perfect.  AND THEY SAID, "I LOVE YOU," something that was blaringly absent in "Twilight".  Chris Weitz has made a stunning, gorgeous film that lovers of the book will adore!  **I secretly wish he could remake "Twilight".  This is what "Twilight" should have been!**  This closet Twilighter was pleased beyond belief.
 
 It seems like most of the critics' negative reviews have problems with the plot, the story, etc.  Well, if you like the book and, therefore, like the plot and the story, you will love the film because Chris Weitz is true to the book beyond what I could have imagined or hoped for.  This movie felt like it was made for the fans, so I can understand that if you're not a fan of the series how it may feel like a laboured effort to watch "New Moon".  But if you love Bella and Edward **and even Jacob--Taylor Lautner was FANTASTIC in this!**, you will leave wanting more!
 
 Chris Weitz for "Breaking Dawn"!
