<REVIEW>
The instructions with the package are really quite poor. They could do a better job at making sure you go to the video to see a demonstration. Fortunately I read enough reviews to know this ahead of time and installed the protectors without a problem. Didn't really see the point of the side protection pieces. I did put one piece on to protect from the dreaded antenna attenutation problems, but it made the stainless steel look dingy, so I took it off - wasn't having much antenna problem anyway. 
 
 The organge peel effect you get with this protector really detracts from the crispness of the iPhone 4 display. And I dislike the tacky feel this protector has - my fingers don't glide, they skid when I'm using the touch screen. I'll be ordering the Powersupport Crystal screen protector when it comes out. Had very good experience with it on my two previous iPhones. Might keet the ZAGG on the back where the tacky feel has some benefit; especially if the Powersupport doesn't come with a rear protector.
