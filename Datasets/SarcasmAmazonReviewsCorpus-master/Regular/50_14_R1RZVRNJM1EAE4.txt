<REVIEW>
This movie is great, and full of action.  I was never a fan of wrestling and knew very little about the Rock.  I rented this movie last night for my boyfriend and I to watch. Since I was strictly informed not to get any chick-flicks, I figured this was the best choice.  It is based on a true story about a guy named Beauford Pusser (gross name) who after comming home from the millitary notices a great deal of change in his home town. The mill he and his father once worked at is now closed and the main source of income for this small town is the casino/strip club owned by his former friend.  Things turn ugly whe Chris Vaughn (The Rock) notice the casino is cheating their customers.  He tries to go to the police and they are just as crooked as the casino, so the Rock takes matters into his own hands.  Great movie choice for ladies wanting to please their boyfriend with a non-chickflick. But don't worry ladies even if you don't like the story line, you will still enjoy it, because the Rock is very nice to look at!! Enjoy.
