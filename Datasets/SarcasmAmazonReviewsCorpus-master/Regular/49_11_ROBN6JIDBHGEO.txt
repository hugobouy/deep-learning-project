<REVIEW>
The product is exactly as depicted. I search amazon for currently available iPad cases and I think this is the best one available.  The leather foods good, the iPad fits snug in the case and the prop up slots for viewing the device at various angles works great. Used this during a long flight and am very happy with my purchase.
