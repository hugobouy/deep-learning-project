<REVIEW>
Very disappointed.  I have read the entire series, pre-order each book.  Can't wait to sit down and laugh out loud.  Didn't happen this time.  Took me three days to read the book because it was so formulaic, so boring, so unreal, and just not funny.  Unbelievable story-line.  I don't like Vinnie.  I don't understand where Blutto came from, too many unanswered questions.  I think Stephanie needs to get some counseling, she has real issues.  I found two spelling errors in the book which hasn't happened before.  Sorry, Janet, this one just isn't sizzling at all.
