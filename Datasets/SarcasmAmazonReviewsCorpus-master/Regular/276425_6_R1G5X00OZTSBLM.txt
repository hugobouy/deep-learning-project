<REVIEW>
MOMMY'S LITTLE GIRL reads like a novel built on excellent organization & story development.  Unfortunately, it is not fiction.  The victim & protagonist, Caylee Anthony was a real child and Casey Anthony, the antagonist you love to hate was her mother.  Diane Fanning exhibited an uncanny ability to make the reader feel he/she experienced the unfolding of this story.  It's amazing how we can relate to these characters, good & bad.  Certainly it's not over yet but time and the courts will write the final chapter.
 
 The research and organization that went into MOMMY'S LITTLE GIRL shows a mastery of the craft as does the ability to create a sense of the flow of this story that unfolded in starts, jerks, detours and stops.  It would have been easy to just lay out the facts & say, "Here it is!" but in fact, that is left for the reader. Even the well-written afterword leaves room for the reader to draw conclusions.  
 
 I strongly recommend this book for anyone trying to delve into the details of this or any true crime case.  It's definitely a step above.
