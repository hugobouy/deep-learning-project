<REVIEW>
As previously noted these movies are all great movies and the sound and picture quality on the dvd's themselves are outstanding. Great work! I would have given it five stars but the lack of extra's for the price I payed is out there. Where are the deleted scenes that were repeatedly mentioned? If Lucas and Speilberg refuse to do commentary then why aren't there cast commentaries? No outtakes reel! Granted the 2 hour documentary is very nice and I love seeing the trailers its just a set like this should have been loaded. Lets take for example the Back to the Future dvd's, yes there was that whole widescreen issue but the extra's on those dvd's had everything, 2 commentaries for each disk, documentaries, and deleted scenes, plus the price was resonable!  Like I said most of us will be happy with these dvd's for the most part, and for the proper 2:35 widescreen transfers but I felt Lucas could have included a lot more extra's than were included on this set. Marketing I suppose in a few years it will be rereleased again with all new features, but at the moment I think Indiana Jones is almost up there with Star Wars for the record amount of rereleases.
