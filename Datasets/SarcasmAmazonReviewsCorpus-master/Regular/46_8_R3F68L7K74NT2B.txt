<REVIEW>
The Clash of the Titans remake is not as bad as some are saying and the movie is quite enjoyable, I think in 2D or even on DVD it would have been a lot better. I love the new 3D digital movies that are being made at the moment but this was a real mess. I understand that it wasn't shot in 3D and was therefore converted afterwards, what were they thinking about ? The picture was awful and in most scenes it looked as though someone was standing behind the main actors. After seeing the true 3D magic of Avatar I was really disappointed. I think I will purchase it on DVD and hopefully the picture will look better on my 42in screen that it did in the cinema. I don't think I would watch a converted 3D movie again as it just cheapens the expierence. I would have given it 4 stars but the let down of the 3D only rates it 3 stars.
