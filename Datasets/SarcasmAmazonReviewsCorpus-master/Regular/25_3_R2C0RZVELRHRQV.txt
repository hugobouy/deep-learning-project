<REVIEW>
This book is readable, informative and appears to be very well-documented.  As a former apologist for Bill Clinton, I have to say that this book was a revelation to me and frankly made me a little queasy.  I can't believe that I helped put this man in office.  Morris can speak with genuine admiration about many of the positive steps, but also chronicles the dark side in a way that many of my former fellows will find hard to accept.  Despite some significant accomplishments during his administration, there was confusion, ineptitude, cronyism, lack of vision, and downright corruption. 
 I was on the one hand proud of Clinton for things like his extension of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which lifted so many low-income families out of poverty, and on the other hand absolutely enraged by the dithering and delay and lack of action in Afganistan, Iran, Iraq, Bosnia, and Rwanda that contributed to hundreds of thousands of deaths, thereby emboldening Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda to commit acts of mass murder on our own soil.
  
 I am left with the forlorn feeling that, with both the Clintons, there was always a lot less there than meets the eye.
 
 Allow me to apologize if you disagree with my perspective...my advisors made me write this...
