<PRODUCT>Belly Laughs: The Naked Truth about Pregnancy and Childbirth (Paperback)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
There are a lot of pregnancy books out there that just, in my option, want to just give you the facts, overlooking the fact that pregnant women need to laugh a little, too. Well, thankfully, there is Belly Laughs and while it is filled with the trials and tribulations of pregnancy, Ms. Mccarthy never fails to poke a little fun at it, too, and at herself. It's just a great read all pregnant women should read. I also liked and would suggest Really Pregnant! Confessions of a New Mom-To-Be or Why I Couldn't Stop Eating Brownies .
