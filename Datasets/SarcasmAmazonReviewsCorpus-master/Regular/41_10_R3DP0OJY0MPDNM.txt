<REVIEW>
It has been many moons since we laughed so hard and had so much fun watching an animated film. The Fantastic Mr. Fox, which of course I read long ago, is a most stunning and hilarious treat that I know we will watch again and again.
 
 The reviews here are splendid, so I will hone in on some points:
 
 1. Desplat has done it again with a soundtrack that kicks just right...yet he doesn't interfere with the terrific songs such as selections from Brian Wilson's "Heroes and Villains".
 
 2. The vocal talent here is unmatched in animated experience. George Clooney pitted against Sir Michael Gambon? Bill Murray sparring with Jason Schwartzman and Wes Anderson (who voiced as well as directed)...superb! Even the inimitable Brian Cox makes an absolutely side-splitting cameo.
 
 3. I haven't seen gripping stop-motion animation like this since the last time I saw a Russian animated film...and that was LOOOOONG ago. This is such a must-see for all children.
 
 4. Saying which, I think the substitution of the word "cuss" where all cuss words would normally be used is one of the most brilliant things I've ever heard.
 
 5. In case anyone misses the point, Roald Dahl, who was decades ahead of his time, meant this story to be a basic morality play about mankind's greed and seeming hatred toward animals. Yet the film also shows in the most humorous way the nature of wild animals as well. Who do you think is and ought to be the victor in this?
 
 6. Keep eyes and ears peeled for various homages and references that the kids might miss.
 
 Marvelous, and I only wish I had more stars to award it! OSCAR time for Best Animated Film feature-length!
