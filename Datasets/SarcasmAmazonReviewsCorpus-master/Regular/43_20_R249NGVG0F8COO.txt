<REVIEW>
This is tool is sensitive enough to detect higher than normal EMF's.
 I took it around my house just to make sure it's working and it hit everywhere I knew there were high emfs, without fail. the light is bright enough to see yet not so bright that you lose your night vision. if you need more precise readings I would suggest getting something digital but this works great for me.
