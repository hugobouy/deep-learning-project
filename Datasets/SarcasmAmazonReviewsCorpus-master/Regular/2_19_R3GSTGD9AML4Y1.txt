<REVIEW>
To start, I've used whitening strips before.  And they've always worked very well on me.  I never had any sensitivity to any sort of strip, so, I was confident that Crest's newest 3D whitening strips would be fine for me.  And they were!  
 
 After just 3 days of using the strips, I noticed a dramatic difference in the color of my coffee-stained teeth!  I noticed the change in color both in person, as well as in photographs of myself.  After 10 days, my teeth were glowing white - not so white that you'd think they were fake, just a nice, healthy white smile! 
 
 I have nothing but great things to say about Crest's 3D Whitestrips!  The "advanced seal" is amazing - no more goopy strips that feel like they are slipping everywhere in your mouth!  These strips are going to be my go-to strips every six months now!  These are fantastic!
