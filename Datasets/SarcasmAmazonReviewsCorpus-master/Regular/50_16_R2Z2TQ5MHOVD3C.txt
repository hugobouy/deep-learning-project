<REVIEW>
After having devoured The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)  I was very much looking forward to The Girl Who Played With Fire. But somehow the story did not captivate me as much as the first Lisbeth Salander / Mikael Blomkvist book. And here are my main points of criticism:
 
 1. There is no direct interaction between Lisbeth and Mikael in this story. They are connected by the events, yes, but the unique relationship that had begun to develop between them in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was not continued here, and for me this was a key element and one of the main reasons I was so fascinated with the characters. With every page I turned (and there are many!), I was hoping to see them come together again, alas it only happened at the very end of the book and even then there was no communication between the two.
 
 2. The storyline - to me - was much less believable than in the first book. There are a few (for lack of a better word) improbabilities here that almost ruined it for me. Especially the scene towards the end, where Lisbeth is confronted with her brother and her father and their unspeakable act against her (I don't want to give anything away, so no details but you will know what I mean when you get to it). The coherence I so admired in the first book was just not that well executed in The Girl Who Played with Fire (Vintage) .
 
 3. The end came extremely abruptly. I actually went online after finishing it to make sure that I hadn't somehow received an issue with some of the pages missing. I just couldn't believe that this book with several hundred pages and tons of details given on those would simply end like this. But it did and left me shaking my head a bit.
 
 In summary, this is not a bad thriller but it did not reach the masterful craftsmanship and effortlessness that made the first book an absolute standout in the ocean of thrillers on the market.
