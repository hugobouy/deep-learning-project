<REVIEW>
I hate to admit it, but this book really illustrates the poor research and constant mistruths that come from my party.  Coulter is a disgrace to not just the right but America and all it stands for.  Hannity and Colmes should be re-named to the Sean Hannity Show because Alan Colmes simply is not as vociferous as his counterpart and it hurts the left.  I'm Republican but more importantly I'm a proud American.  I would prefer to hear fair and balanced because it is good for public discourse but it simply is not happening and never will. He who yells loudest is usually the one heard.  I was really disheartened to learn the truths about Al Gore and Love Canal, the Internet and Love Story.  Franken illustrates the truth about the lies that were told by the media that negatively affected Gore's run for the presidency.  It is worth buying this book just to read about this alone.  Some that read this review may question my loyalty to the GOP.  At times I do myself.  I simply wish that everyone would put the country first rather than their agenda.  After completing the book I'm a little more than disillusioned with the lies in the media.  We should stand for it no longer.  This is an excellent book for everyone!
