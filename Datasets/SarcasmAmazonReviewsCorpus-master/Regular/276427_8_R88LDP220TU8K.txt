<REVIEW>
I love the idea of the singularity.  I think Ray Kurzweil is a god among men.  His enthusiasm and passion make me want to believe.  But it may take my entire life to finish reading this book.  It's dense and not very beginner-friendly for those of us who want to learn more about the topic.  Don't let that discourage you though.  This is really powerful, interesting stuff.
