<REVIEW>
I was initially upset because I paid for 1 day shipping early enough to "receive" it the following day...however it was not "shipped" until the following day.  It arrived after I had left for a weekend trip out of state (Still hoping to qualify for a reimbursement).
 Ok my gripe session is out of the way...shipping has no bearing on the quality of the product.
 
 I got to use it for the first time this morning and I am thrilled with it.  This is my fourth Nuvi...I upgrade every so often and this was one I could not resist.
 
 One of the features that I noticed right off is that, for example, you are driving down the highway and you slow down to take an exit ramp...it will zoom in as you are slowing allowing you a better view.  LOVE THAT.  
 
 The free traffic is a bonus and it's accuracy is OK...not great but OK.  
 
 The display is phenomenal and definitely a fingerprint magnet, but in no way distracting while being used...mainly when it is turned off will you notice the prints.
 
 One of my favorite features is the additional data you can choose to display on the right hand side of the screen.  I have current time, Arrival Time, and Distance showing on mine...it is customizable though and you can choose what you want to display...including Direction of Travel and Elevation.
 
 It is a true Groovy Nuvi in that Garmin makes the best GPS units on the market(My opinion) and this one allows you to have your cake and eat it too.  Not to mention the icing is great.
 
 Garmin even has a program you can download for free from your online account called voice studio.  If you are tired of the same old computer voices, have your spouse or child record their voice and then upload onto your 3790T...Very tempting, indeed!
 
 If you want a true state of the art, top of the line unit that has all the bells and whistles, you can't go wrong with the Garmin 3790T.
 I'm still getting used to all the amenities and am having a blast with it so far (I have an hour and 45 minute commute each way to work)
