<REVIEW>
I bought it and it worked right for some time. After a couple of hours, it starts making scratchy, distorted sounds in the background of the song really screwing the experience up. Some tracks just carry the noise throughout. This is a prob i've experienced with chinese MP3 CD players but this is a first on memory devices.
 
 I have returned my Purchase and suggest that others try another model of SANSA or go for an ipod shuffle. Saves you the effort of buying, returning and/or following up on the refund.
