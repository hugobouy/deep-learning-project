<REVIEW>
This could be one of the most important books you ever read.  The Secret Life of Bill Clinton is essential to understanding the serious corruption that has infested our government under Bill Clinton.  Most significantly,  Ambrose Evans-Pritchard's exposure of the existence and workings of the  murderous Arkansas mafia from which Bill Clinton hatched is something every  American should understand - particularly that Clinton brought elements of  it with him right into the White House.  Drug-trafficker Dan Lasater's  chief lieutenant Patsy Thomasson, for example, is Clinton's Director of the  White House Office of Administration.  In no other book are the ugly facts  and sinister associations laid with such stark clarity. Evans-Pritchard  writes with a clear and graceful style, laced with doses of dry English  wit.  Reviewing the fishy crime scene evidence relating to the gun found in  Vincent Foster's hand, for example, he observes: &quot;The revolver...had  not found its final resting place.  The crime scene photos show it hopping  about in a most animated way in Foster's hand.&quot;    As a result of  Evans-Pritchard being one of the small handful of journalists who actually  investigated the death of Vincent Foster and certain other Clinton-related  matters, he developed contacts and relationships with key witnesses and  others that provide his his book with devestating factual revelations that  cannot be found elsewhere. For example, the first person known to have  seen Vincent Foster's body in Fort Marcy Park, officially known as the  &quot;Confidential Witness&quot; is absolutely certain that at the time he  saw the body there was no gun.  He tells Evans-Pritchard:  &quot;The whole  thing stinks, he clearly didn't shoot himself there.  You can't shoot  yourself without a gun.  The man had no gun.  End of story.&quot; Another  example:  Jerry Parks was a Little Rock private investigator with  long-standing ties to Vincent Foster, as well as having been head of  security for the 1992 Clinton-Gore headquarters in Little Rock.  He had a  file on Clinton extra-marital affairs that Foster had hired him to compile  several years earlier.  He was murdered gangland-style two months after the  Foster death and the files were stolen.  Evans-Pritchard, over a  several-year period, was able to get Parks' widow and son to open up to him  and provide extraordinary revelations tying his murder to the White  House. Evans-Pritchard, an Englishman, has an obvious affection for this  country and an admiration for the finer qualities of the American  character. His protagonists are the ordinary people who fight the abuses of  power and corruption from their little corner.  &quot;It makes me feel  almost proud to witness such defiance,&quot; he says.  I was moved by his  seeing the virtue in our country and its people while in the midst of  exposing the  putrid evil and corruption that few seem to realize even  exists. I wonder what motivated the man, a Brit on temporary assignment  in the U.S., to perform the tremendous service to this country that I  believe he has.  I don't know, but I suspect it is a highly developed sense  of justice and a properly aroused moral indignation.  He came to the U.S.  at the end of 1992 as an admirer of Bill and Hillary Clinton, but over time  came to realize they were very different from their packaging.  He explains  &quot;Sending people to prison on false charges - or trying to do so - is  his [Clinton's] specialty, which is the chief reason I have come to revile  the man.&quot;  Of course, if you only get your information from the  mainstream media, you wouldn't have any idea of what he is talking about -  which is all the more reason to read this book. Evans-Pritchard wrote a  farewell article when he left America to return to England, the subtitle of  which was &quot;Rouse and Guard Your Liberties.&quot;  The warning is apt,  but you will have to read the book to understand why.
