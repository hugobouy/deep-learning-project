<REVIEW>
I've loved all three of Tori's books.  She is relatable (although living a very different life than most of us) and struggles with similar issues and conflicts as most women her age.  She is a great story teller who isn't afraid to share intimate moments.  At times I feel sorry for her, but also impressed that she has the courage to put it all out there.  I would read any book that Tori put her perfectionist, workaholic, creative, inspiring touches on - keep them coming!
