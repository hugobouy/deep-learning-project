<PRODUCT>Hitachi EC12 14.5 amp 2-Horsepower 4-Gallon Oiled Twin Hot Dog Compressor (Tools & Hardware)</PRODUCT>
<REVIEW>
This machine is yet another good example of high quality Hitachi engineering.  This compressor has outlasted several other brands.  The machine has run two finishing guns continuously for almost a year and  hasn't needed anything more than an oil change The regulator is  predictable, and adjusts as easily as other brands.  I firmly believe that  Hitachi gets 4.1 CFM out of 14.5 amps.  We simply do not run out of air no  matter how fast we are working with the Senco SFN40's.    Down time has  been zilch.  One thing we did add was a water/oil separator and filter to  protect our work and our guns.  I suppose Hitachi (and most other brands)  leaves these off so that they will have a competitive price.  But it does  not make economical sense for YOU to leave them off.  While I have given  this compressor a 5 star rating, there are some things for the engineers  (and you!) to think about in the next model:   1. The way the regulator is  mounted it is difficult to make a manifold for two hoses without hanging  those pipes out there where they can get knocked off.  Anyone who has  knocked one off before will know that A) everyone in the neighborhood knows  it right away and B) it puts you down for some expensive time.  And C) when  this happens, it often creates an unwanted projectile.  It took me three  street elbows and an hour of figuring to get the quick disconnects in a  safe place. 2. When you pick the unit up with the handle, the unit tilts a  bit.  This means you have to hold it out away from your body a bit more  than the size of the compressor would promise.  All that horsepower weighs  enough to make this more uncomfortable than need be.  We just bent the  handle with a torch to get on the center of gravity. These are relatively  small gigs on a really great compressor.  I only spent so many words on  them so that the engineers might just read this.  It seems they will have  plenty of time to correct this before the ones I own wear.
