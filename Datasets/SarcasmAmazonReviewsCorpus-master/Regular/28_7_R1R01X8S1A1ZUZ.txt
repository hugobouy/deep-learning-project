<REVIEW>
I use the nono on my upper lip and chin, even though the user manual says not to. In order to get close to upper lip hair without burning my actual lip, I hold a facecloth over my lip with my other hand.
 
 I have had laser hair removal on this area in the past but it is expensive, and it only worked ok, not great. The nono actually works better than laser hair removal did for me. It is easy and fast to use, and less expensive than laser hair removal. I use it about every 3-4 days.
 
 It works good, not great. Works better on my lip than my chin. I have been using it for about 4 weeks and I am seeing a decrease in the amount of hair. I have very sensitive skin so between the nono and the 'buffing' afterward, my skin does feel a little chapped, but not to bad, I put neosporin on the area or that sally hansen 'zero irritation' bikini area cream and that helps too. sometimes I get little papercut like marks if I go over any one area to many times, but they are not so visible. Sometimes it takes a little while for the little bits of hairs to work themselves all the way out from underneath the skin, you can kind of see and feel them in there before the come out, and it might take a little bit of coaxing with squeezing your the skin between your fingers or a tweezer just to guide out the bit of hair. Overall, I am pleased. It is not a miracle cure, but it does work well for me, it's fast, easy and cheaper and works better than using laser hair removal over and over. Plus, you can do it right from home.  I would recommend this product!- Dottie from Massachusetts
