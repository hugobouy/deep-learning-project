<REVIEW>
I'm not going to be too technical in my review.  I've owned this printer for a week now and don't have many complaints.  Loading the paper is very easy.  Photo paper is loaded in the back.  So far the pictures I've printed looked great.  No problem with scanning and copying.  It's very quick in handling all my tasks.  Also, one major feature that I love is the built in double sided page printing.  No need for a duplexer! The only thing I don't like is the little panel that comes up on the side.  A bit flimsy for me. 
 
 So, overall I'm impressed with this device.  Very fast and a nice looking printer for the price.  I don't think you will be disappointed in purchasing this printer.
