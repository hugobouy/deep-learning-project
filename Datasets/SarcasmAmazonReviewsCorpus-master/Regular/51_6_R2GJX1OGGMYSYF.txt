<REVIEW>
What a great stroller and seat. This stroller is high quality, so yes, there's a high price tag! But it's worth it. People are constantly complimenting my new stroller. It's a cutting edge stroller and the price tag shows it. I have a 2 month old and a 17m old... it's perfect for us! Thanks Baby Jogger for yet another great product!
 
 Update: 2.5 months later- still LOVING my stroller! I have both seats, and the car seat adapter. Love, love, love it. It's the most expensive baby product we own and it should be- I use it the most. I wanted a stroller that would allow me to bust out of the house with two babies or just one baby if needed... this did it. I don't need two strollers anymore! By the way, our boys are huge and this stroller holds them well. Our 18 month old is 30 pounds and the 3 month old is 16 pounds... still trucks along like nothing!
