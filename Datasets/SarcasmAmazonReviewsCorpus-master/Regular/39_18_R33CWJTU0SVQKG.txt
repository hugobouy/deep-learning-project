<REVIEW>
This is it--the surefire way to get relunctant boy readers engrossed in cool and educational reading.  My teenage son can usually find anything to do except read, but he reads this cover to cover and is always reading the highlights to me.  The perfect gift for boys who are fascinated with science, flight, or interesting stuff such as the account of a couple of chemists who use liquid nitrogen to make ice cream in 30 seconds--OK so you don't want them to try that at home, but get this mag for your young scientists.  They will love it.
